I called to have my bill recalculated based upon my income and I was eventually told my new payment would be {$390.00}.

I made my payment in good faith for the amount I was told was due. Obviously if the representative would have told me to pay an additional {$12.00} I would have done it.

Doc 2 clearly shows my payment of {$390.00}, no amount past due, and a XXXX payment due of {$390.00}. ( apparently this was an additional statement error that was then changed to {$410.00} ).

I can enumerate all of the issues below : Initially, I have always been a public servant when repaying my student loans, and have always attempted to be qualified for the public service loan forgiveness program.\n\n1. I was given completely incorrect information regarding payment plans, payment amounts, and was not provided the right information regarding the lowest payment possible. For the first several years ( XXXX ) I was not making the lowest payment possible. I found out many years later that I could have qualified for payments under {$100.00} a month, but was paying 2 or 3 times that amount at any point.\n\n2. I took out a mortgage on my home to pay down my balances. I made it VERY clear that I wanted the payment to go towards the principal balance. Yet, Navient ( around XX/XX/XXXX ) repeatedly applied the balance to future payments. For nearly 3 months I repeatedly called Navient to have them apply the balance to the principal. I am still unsure if they charged me interest on the larger principal balance during that time. \n\n3. I was told in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not have to certify my student loans for PSLF until I had made 120 payments, and that Navient was keeping track of those payments. However, I recently found that many of my coworkers certify their employment on an annual basis, and that their loans are held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted, once a month, for the last 18 months ( XX/XX/XXXX to present day ) to get information from Navient regarding any PSLF certification paperwork. They REPEATEDLY told me they would send me information via email or mail, and I would never receive this paperwork. Finally, I went online and did a search on my own. I have attempted to get documentation regarding my numerous phone calls and was told they do not email others. Further, I was told that they do not keep any log of calls made by borrowers.",["numer","loan","compani","select","issu","previous","page","enumer","initi","alway","public","servant","repay","student","alway","qualifi","public","servic","loan","forgiv","program","given","complet","incorrect","inform","regard","payment","payment","provid","right","inform","regard","payment","possibl","first","sever","make","payment","possibl","found","mani","later","could","qualifi","month","pay","time","amount","point","took","mortgag","home","made","clear","payment","toward","princip","balanc","around","repeat","appli","balanc","futur","near","repeat","appli","balanc","princip","still","unsur","interest","princip","balanc","time","told","certifi","student","made","keep","track","howev","recent","found","mani","certifi","employ","annual","basi","month","last","present","inform","regard","certif","repeat","told","would","send","inform","mail","would","never","receiv","final","went","search","document","regard","numer","phone","told","told","keep","made"]],["On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to Navient Collections department. I was told that my assigned agent XXXX was unavailable so I spoke to a XXXX instead. This representative told me that I had been rejected from the income based repayment program ( after setting up about 3 years of a monthly auto-debit of {$720.00} ). He said that I needed to have my co-signer ( mother ) call in to submit her financial statement before being able to resubmit me for approval. I am nearing default on my loans because they never approved my {$720.00} payments and tell me I need to be making principal payments of around {$1200.00}. The fact that I was nearing default on only some of my loans but not others leads me to believe that they are misapplying my payments. I believe that if my payment had been applied proportionally to each loan, I wouldnt have reached this stage in my delinquency so soon. By applying my payments in this way, Navient is ensuring that I default on my loans more quickly. \n\nOn Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, my mother called in and provided her financial statement. She spoke to another representative named XXXX, who said that XXXX was not available and XXXX would be out for a long time. His version of what happened differed from XXXX. He told my mom that her financial information wouldnt necessarily help me and that I had to make another financial statement ( the last financial statement I made was in XXXX ). They convinced her to make a payment of about {$290.00} to pull some of my loans out of risk of default. \n\nOn Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called the number that XXXX had given me. I was surprised to be told that my loan was no longer handled by that department and now the person I was speaking to ( cant recall the name ) was my new assigned agent. I was skeptical and pushed to try to speak to the agent that was familiar with my situation, the agent put a supervisor on the line who said they could not transfer me to XXXX and that I would need to work with them. They were not familiar with my situation at all. They convinced me to make a payment of {$29.00} and to submit more financial information. \n\nThat same night on Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called back to see if I could get some more information about my loans. I couldnt find any statements online from before XXXX of XXXX. The Navient website offered no clear way to see a record of my individual loan payments, how theyve been applied, and how theyve affected my principal balance. When I asked the agent from Navient if they could provide an electronic copy of this, they told me it was impossible. Moreover, that kind of request had to be submitted to the back office and could take a week or more to send. She transferred me to general customer service to see if they could help me get the information from the website, however that agent was also not helpful. Not only did she confirm that the Navient website has no way to access loan records and documents, she also could not give me accurate answers to questions I was asking in regard to my loan history. She told me my first payment was made in XXXX, but I graduated in XXXX and started making payments in XXXX. \n\nNavient is purposefully making it difficult for me to get accurate information about my options and my loan history. While it is difficult to come up with an accurate figure based on the limited information on the website, I estimate that I have made well over {$50000.00} in payments to Navient/Sallie Mae since my college graduation.

We have summarized its plan below. At the bottom of this post is a list of campuses that XXXX XXXX has said it will close. \n\nINFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES HOW THE CLOSURES WILL AFFECT STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED Through leaked XXXX XXXX memos and accountsandformsshared by current students, the XXXX on Predatory Student Lending has learned that XXXX XXXX is giving students at closing campuses 5 options. Here is what weve learned, some information about loan cancellation, and important things to keep in mind until we learn more. A full list of affected schools is at the end of this post. \nOptions For Students at Closing Schools XXXX XXXX announced that students may choose from the following 5 options for how to continue their education : -Complete your degree at your current campus by the end of XXXX, when the campus will close -Complete your degree via the XXXX XXXX XXXX -Complete your degree at another XXXX XXXX campus -Complete your degree at another XXXX XXXX school, either XXXX University or XXXX University -Transfer to another , unspecified university outside the XXXX XXXX network of schools XXXX XXXX is trying to convince students to accept these options by offering a 50 % tuition reduction to students who remain at a XXXX XXXX   school and a {$5000.00} tuition grant to students who transfer to one the unspecified other schools. \nWe have not been able to determine what will happen to students who choose not to accept these options, but it is likely that they will be automatically withdrawn from their program. \nStudents should notlet XXXX XXXX trick them into accepting these offers before they have all the information they need to make an informed decision! Only accept an offer once you have all the information and if its the best option for you. \nAs part of these offers, XXXX XXXX will make students sign acknowledge forms and waivers that will relieve it of any responsibility it owes to students and may prevent students from receiving relief from their federal loans in the future. \nStudents should notsign anything until they have read it carefully, had all of their questions answered, and decided that what the best decision is for them! \nXXXX XXXX is Trying to Deprive Students of Their Right to Loan Cancellation The federal government has a program called the Closed School Discharge program that will cancel federal student loans when students schools close. It is only available to students who are enrolled when the school closes or who had withdrawn within 120 days of the school closure. Students who accept an offer to continue their education somewhere else when their school closes do not qualify for Closed School Discharges. \nIn a public disclosure, the XXXX XXXX XXXX, an accrediting agency that oversees two XXXX XXXX campuses in Illinois and Colorado, recognizes that these schools are at risk of closing and urges students to be aware of Closed School Discharges. XXXX XXXX does not want its students to get Closed School Discharges! Thats because they will have to pay back the government for each loan that is cancelled from its schools. \nXXXX XXXX timed its closings so that anyone who withdraws will do so more than 120 from the closing, and is using tuition discounts to convince students to stay enrolled. These are both ways to prevent students from qualifying for a Closed School Discharge. This is not right! \nImportant Information for Students Theres still a lot that we dont know about XXXX XXXX plan to close its school, and how that will affect students rights. While we wait to learn more, it is important for affected students to ask questions, share information, and protect themselves. Here are a few specific things you can do : -Ask your school for to be placed on a formal leave of absence. XXXX XXXX   schools may not agree to give leaves of absence, but if they do it may help buy some time and maintain students eligibility for Closed School Discharges -Do not sign anything without reading it completely, getting all of your questions answered, and understanding how it affects your right to a Closed School Discharge or to enforce your rights against your school. XXXX XXXX might try to have you waive your rights. Do not do that without understanding the full impact of that decision, which will vary student by student. \n-Share your experience and information!! There are 1000s of students across the country that are affected by this. Join XXXX groups. If you receive information from your school, share it! \n-Visit the Debt Collective website and learn how borrowers across the country are fighting back against bad schools and unfair and illegal debt. \n-Continue to visit this blog for updates. \n-Contact your U.S. representative or senator and let them know whats happening!

Former students may wish to file claims in one or more of the bankruptcy cases ; more information will follow in the coming days. \nPlease visit the Federal Student Aid website, the Debt Collective, or contactthe XXXX   on Predatory Student Lending ( thats us! ) to learn more. \nThe XXXX on Predatory Student Lending is fighting for and with students who have been cheated by the predatory federally-funded colleges.

The acquisition would convert three of the corporations chainsthe XXXX XXXX, XXXX University, and XXXX Universityinto nonprofits. XXXX will retain ownership of the XXXX XXXX chain, which is shutting down most of its campuses, and the 19 XXXX XXXX campuses the corporation is in the process of shutting down. \nXXXXs conversion to nonprofit status raises critical questions, including how the corporation intends to ensure positive student outcomes once it is no longer subject to gainful employment regulations. XXXX has more than 130 programs that the federal government has found to burden graduates with unmanageable student loan debtprograms that will be subject to even less federal oversight once they have been sold to a nonprofit. XXXXs compliance with federal requirements attached to the receipt of federal Title IV funds will be even more critical once the corporation is no longer subject to the 90-10 rule, which prevents for-profit colleges from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenues from such funds.\n\nLike the last-ditch sale of many XXXX campuses as that company failed, this sale leaves failing schools with XXXX, while selling off assets that may still have value to a new entity that may disclaim liability for the acts of its predecessors. This type of transaction leaves former students struggling with unmanageable debt even more completely without recourse. \nLess than a year ago, XXXX tried to sell the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, an XXXX XXXX campus in XXXX, Massachusetts, to a university based in XXXX. The deal was scuttled after the corporations failed to obtain state approval. As XXXXs equity holders continue to try to divest themselves of these assets, regulators should demand assurances that whoever owns the schools will operate them in the interests of students. \nXXXX The XXXX  on Predatory Student Lending represents a group of former students who attended the XXXX-owned XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, these former students demanded that the companies remedy the harms they had caused to students and their families. The XXXX  and Public Justice are currently challenging the federal governments refusal to provide documents shedding light on XXXXs recruiting practices. \nRead more XXXX on Predatory Student Lending Sues Federal Government For Withholding For-Profit College Corporations Recruitment Records XXXX, News, XXXX on Predatory Student Lending - XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, theXXXX on Predatory Student Lendingof the Legal Services Center of XXXX XXXX XXXX filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit, challenging the governments refusal to provide documents shedding light on for-profit college giant XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) s recruitment practices. \nMonths ago, the XXXX filed a FOIA request with the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), seeking access to these documents. DOJ claimed that it couldnt release the documents ( in part ) because it said there was a court order preventing it from doing so. The XXXX disagreed. So, together with XXXX XXXX, we asked the court that issued the order to clarify that the order does not, in fact, prevent DOJ from releasing the documents. \nSoon after we asked the court for clarification, however, DOJ changed its tune entirely. It now claims that the public has no right to access these documents, even though they were produced to the government by a corporation the government alleged defrauded it of billions of dollars, and would enable the public to evaluate the governments decision to settle its claims for less than one percent of what it had originally said they were worth. \nThe lawsuit challenges the governments assertion that the public has no right to these important documents. \nTwo Federal Lawsuits, Still No Documents Federal regulations allow student loan borrowers to seek cancellation of their federal student loans by showing that their school violated state law. Former students of the XXXX XXXX and other XXXX-owned chains thus want the documents to help prove that they were defrauded, and are entitled to relief on their student loans. Because these documents have been kept secretand because XXXX usesforced arbitration clausestodrive students out of the public court systemborrowers seeking debt relief often have little but their own personal experiences to support their claims of misconduct. \nThe Attorney General of Minnesotaone of the states that participated in the caseexpressed support for the XXXX efforts, stating that the information requested by the XXXX could aid students in their efforts to obtain loan forgiveness from the United States Department of Education, which would unburden them from thousands of dollars of debt. \nThe XXXX  has made a significant effort to obtain these documentsfiling a freedom of information request, litigating the governments denial of that request, and moving to intervene to challenge the government and XXXXs efforts to keep the documents secretbecause the documents are critical to the XXXX advocacy on behalf of low-income student loan borrowers. The documents will help the XXXX seek relief for former students of XXXX-owned schools ; inform the public about the practices of for-profit education companies and the governments oversight of those companies ; and advocate for policies that will protect low-income student loan borrowers. \nBackground : Government Lawsuit Against XXXX XXXX, a corporation that has been closely associated with XXXX XXXX for years, runs four large chains of for-profit schools, including the beleaguered XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, the federal government, along with several states, sued XXXX, alleging that it violated state and federal law and then lied about it to get government funding. The government claimed that, to maximize enrollments, XXXX illegally paid its admissions employees based on the number of students they could enroll ; created a boiler room style sales culture, the relentless and exclusive focus of which was the number of new students each recruiter could sign up ; taught its recruiters to exploit prospective students vulnerabilities ; and rewarded those who recruited the most students with bonuses, extra time off, vacations, and gifts. \nThe lawsuit eventually settled in XXXX for {$95.00} million, less than one percent of the more than {$11.00} billion in taxpayer-funded federal student grants and loans that the government alleged XXXX received between XX/XX/XXXX and the suits filing. The settlement did not relieve students of any of the federal student loan debt they took on to attend XXXX-owned schools. \nDocuments Related to This Case Freedom of Information Act Requests, Appeal, and Complaint : XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Requests to DOJ and Intervening States ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Appeal ( PDF ) Project on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Complaint ( PDF ) Intervention ( XXXX XXXX ) : XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion for Clarification of Protective Order ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Reply in Support of Motion to Intervene ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Reply in Support of Motion for Clarification of Protective Order ( PDF ) About the XXXX on Predatory Student Lending The XXXX on Predatory Student Lending fights for low-income borrowers, representing students and families who have experienced unfair, deceptive, and illegal conduct at the hands of for-profit colleges.

XXXX, the government alleged, created a boiler room style sales culture, the relentless and exclusive focus of which was the number of new students each recruiter could sign up. To maximize enrollments, the lawsuit alleged, XXXX taught its recruiters to exploit prospective students vulnerabilities, and rewarded those who recruited the most students with bonuses, extra time off, vacations, and gifts. \nThe lawsuit eventually settled in XXXX for {$95.00} million, much less thanthe {$1.00} billion the company received in taxpayer-funded federal student grants and loans in the XXXXyear alone. But as part of discovery in the suit, XXXX produced a lot of documents that we believe will shed light on their recruitment practices. The documents from this lawsuit are likely to strengthen claims for relief of hundreds, if not thousands, of former XXXXC students, saidXXXX XXXX, one of the attorneys representing the debtors. \nFormer students of the XXXX XXXX and other XXXX-owned chains want these documents to help prove that they were defrauded, and are entitled to relief on their student loans. Because these documents have so far been kept secretand because XXXX usesforced arbitration clausestodrive students out of the public court systemborrowers seeking debt relief often have little but their own personal experiences to corroborate their claims of misconduct. \nWhile taxpayers spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding what the Department of Justice has called XXXX recruitment mill, the borrowers who attended these schools have yet to obtain federal debt relief, said Public Justice attorney XXXX XXXX. \nBefore filing this lawsuit, the XXXX  tried to get these documents showing XXXXs predatory recruitment practices through federal and state freedom of information requests, but its request was denied in part because of a protective order in the case. The XXXX  asked a federal judge to rule that the protective order does not shield the documents. \nDocuments Related to This Case XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Requests to DOJ and Intervening States ( PDF ) XXXX  on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion for Clarification of Protective Order ( PDF ) About the XXXX  on Predatory Student Lending The XXXX  on Predatory Student Lending fights for low-income borrowers, representing students and families who have experienced unfair, deceptive, and illegal conduct at the hands of for-profit colleges.

I called about 2 weeks ago and spoke to a customer service manager that an option for me to lower my payment would be to refinance the loan with SOFI, which would lower my interest and therefore lower my monthly payment amount. \n\nI applied for a refinance while I was waiting for a forbearance application to be reviewed and approved. The amount I was quoted with the refinance application was under {$700.00}, which would allow me to make my full monthly payment and not have to apply for forbearances. \n\nHowever, the application was 'stalled ' because when I connected my XXXX account to my Sofi application, an communication error between XXXX and SOfi occurred. on XX/XX/XXXX, I called SOFI and was told to call XXXX and ask that they updated their files. I debated why I should have to call XXXX when the issue was between Sofi and XXXX - I had provided all documentation and information requested of me. In the interest of time, I tried to submit the student loan documentation they were requesting manually, but it would not upload to my application. I therefore emailed SOFI directly with the information/documentation. A few hours later, I received a denial of my application - even though I was 1. told to apply, 2. pre-approved, and 3. have a very high credit score, good income, and no delinquencies on my credit report. \n\nIn follow up emails, SOFI explained the reason was because I had not provided documentation of my income and that I had I had a bad internal credit score with SOFI due to my use of forbearances. I had provided documentation of my income, and I'm receiving a 3 % raise in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, these forbearances were approved by SOFI and I was never told that use of necessary forbearances would impact my ability to refinance in the future. Nor was this mentioned as a potential barrier when I was told to apply for a refinance of my loans. \n\nI'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm trying to do what is responsible and necessary in order to not go into default with my private student loans. I asked for guidance on what to do to lower my payment and was told to refinance by SOFI, was preapproved, and provided all necessary documentation/information for my application. By denying my application, SOFI has essentially removed the only mechanism I have to lower my monthly payment amount. This is not being customer friendly or helpful to someone with a high student loan debt burden.

I have had an account with this servicer since XX/XX/XXXX when two Direct Consolidated ( one Subsidized & one Unsubsidized ) Loans were dispersed. \n\nI have been making on time monthly payments to my lender in hopes of qualifying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). This program allows those working for non-profit organizations to receive complete loan forgiveness after 120 monthly payments under a qualifying income-based repayment plan. As a way to track progress, I am obligated to submit employment certification forms to FedLoan which confirms my eligibility and shows my time remaining in the program. Previously, I had received a letter directly from FedLoan Servicing indicating thetotal PSLF qualifying payments I made from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, in which it concluded was 32 qualifying payments.

One has an interest rate of 4.250 % and the other an interest rate of 3.150 %. I selected to manually enter my instructions for the payment and requested 100 % be applied to the higher interest loan, which should have eliminated this loan with a small amount left over. Instead, approximately {$770.00} was applied to this loan and the rest to the lower interest loan. \n\nI acknowledge that it appears there is a caveat in the instructions that pending payments may be applied first, but would note that my loan account also states that I am paid ahead by over {$6000.00}, I am not required to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX, and I had just completed a scheduled payment on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, the payment of this loan as directed would ( to my understanding ) changed what my next scheduled payment will be, as one of the loans would have been eliminated. \n\nFurther, I was unable to determine any place on the Great Lakes site that outlined a breakdown of my scheduled payment per loan in the account rather than for the overall account, making payers unable to discern how to adjust any excess payments. For example, if I have a pending payment of {$150.00} on an account containing two loans, if I wanted to pay one loan off that is {$500.00} and do not know the portion of scheduled payments that might be automatically applied to other loan I do not know how much I should add to that {$150.00} to pay off the {$500.00}.

The sales person had no idea of my skills but found that I wanted to study XXXX and she quickly recruited me to go in for an interview at the campus. When I went to the interview I was told that I had what it took to join and be successful in the field of XXXX XXXX  and that it would be beneficial for me to study there. Before I knew it I was enrolled and the beginning of my student loans had started. The cost for the school was supposed to be XXXX but at graduation it was over XXXX to this day it still remains over $ XXXX. Every quarter there were more and more loans asked for and halfway through the program I knew that there was something wrong and I was just one of many that this school had preyed on. At this point I went to a guidance counselor and she told me that if I don't continue and dropped out that my family would see me as unsuccessful and that everything in this world revolved an accredited XXXX degree. I was unhappy because the XXXX  XXXX program that I signed up for was taken away and now the class of XXXX were being used to work solely on XXXX. A lot of us were not happy with that because they lied to us and switched the curriculum and now our final demo reels had to be in XXXX. Something that I was not into. In the beginning I was told that I would get job placement and will be working with XXXX XXXX. They used a lot of sales tactics to keep me in the school and when I complained about a 3d class that I had to pass and the teacher wouldn't allow me to pass I was given a \" P '' simply because I said I would complain to the board. The teacher was eventually fired for allowing students to pass if they beat him in Halo on the last day of class. His name was XXXX XXXX XXXX. The school was full of untrained teachers. XXXX XXXX was teaching us a class in Shake which she was just learning along with us. I was recruited into a school that didn't care about the students it felt like and only cared about recruitment. It was a for profit school and you can tell that it was based on recruitments because students there the majority didn't have an artistic talent. The school has closed along with many other Art Institutes throughout the country and they have been sued for using predatory sales practices on students that signed up for their programs during the time that I attended. Going to that school was the worst mistake of my life. It has put me in a position where I have been paying for student loans for the past 13 years for a school that has since closed it's doors and is not accredited in anyway. Once I was out I tried to enroll in a different college only to find out that the classes I took there were not considered university or college credits, I would have to take the classes over. The school has been sued and has to forgive student loans due to their malpractice predatory sales tactics which I was a victim of. It's not fair that they did this, preyed on individuals and now closed their doors. I have struggled for years to make payments to those loans and for what, a XXXX Degree that no longer sits on my wall because it isn't worth the paper its printed on. Due to the student loans that I acquired in order to stay in school I have been in financial ruin as I have to pay every month. The loan amount now is higher than it was 13 years ago. It seems that every 6 months I have to file a forbearance or a hardship in order to keep Sallie Mae now Navient at bay. They never explained anything in full detail but always wanted me to sign new loans in order to stay enrolled. I had to resort to have my father help co-sign as well as a neighbor. They did that as favors for my future but there was no future from the teachings I received. They lied and they should be held responsible for their actions. The lawsuit forgives students like me and it's been a long time coming for me to finally take the action against these loans. I have gotten my Federal loans forgiven already due to my complaint.

My story is sad but true. It's like millions of others, I'm sure but still no less sad because it is my own issue. My own life 's issue. I am an XXXX and I pursued my dream of being an XXXX  when I went to college, XXXX University, and then was accepted into the prestigious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   Graduate XXXX Program at XXXX. It was a great program and one where students were afforded many professional opportunities that many XXXX who hadn't gone to school didn't receive. I had received {$40000.00} in scholarship money to attend XXXX and I borrowed another {$40000.00} to pay for living expenses and the tuition difference for the next three years. In addition to the {$10000.00} I had taken out for XXXX study from XXXX, in XXXX I was {$50000.00} in debt with principal at 8.25 % interest. I also had taken out a Perkins loan for {$2500.00} that I had paid off within five years of graduation. After graduating XXXX, I worked in theater steadily for the next three years. My salary at $ XXXX week wasn't tremendous but I was a working XXXX! After the 6 month grace period however my loan servicer, then Sallie Mae, told me I would owe $ XXXXmonth on top of my rent and bills but if that would be a problem they said I could defer payments for upto 2 years or I could \" forbear '' payments, essentially stopping payments, basically so I would not have to worry about payments. As the years went by I had to keep forbearing or deferring payments. My loans were bought and sold as so much trash by XXXX, Navient, Sallie Mae, and finally Navient again. I'm sure there were other servicers who bought the loans but I can not rememember all of them. They seemed to change each or every other year. I would constantly ask for statements at the end of the deferrment period to see how much interest was 'capitalized ' to the principal but most of the servicer 's employees were from XXXX and either they didn't understand what I meant when I said, \" Please send me a paper statement when the loan is about to start repayment so I can see how much interest has accrued '' or they just disregarded it as unimportant. It was probably the latter as I'm sure many of us asked for statements but because the loans had switched hands so much the servicers only needed to get permission to defer or forbear payments and then forget about the rest of the service call. Their bank was getting what they wanted. People whose initial principal wasn't enormous, although owing {$50000.00} is pretty enormous would see the balance balloon to enormous sums because we weren't being kept aware of how the principal kept growing. The agents were always so understanding and supportive on the call about giving out more deferment or forbearance time because we needed help. Outside of paying my rent on a New York rent stabilized apt , borrowing for school has been my only borrowing experience. Fast forward to some years later when I was in a long running play, or on tour and I would have a modest steady income and I would try and knock off some of the principal but the interest alone now was over {$1000.00} so I asked about repayment options. I was put on income sensitive plans or income contingent plans and had some years where I was able to pay some of the loan 's interest back but unfortunately those plan were not the 'right income sensitive ' plan to qualify for payments towards loan forgiveness. Once again, misleading information that is only found out years later when the issue is too big now to be ignored and I'm trying to figure out a way out of this mess. As it stands right now I have about two, maybe three years towards loan forgiveness. My principal is now {$90000.00}! I am in the \" REPAYE '' plan which I need to reapply for each year. This year my payment was $ XXXX month based on my expenses and income from the previous year however I'm still not paying anything toward taking down the principal so the interest gets added to the amount and the amount keeps growing. I'm XXXX years old. Still an XXXX. I make around XXXX/year between XXXX work, side gigs like XXXX, and unemployment but it changes every year and I don't receive a weekly check like a banker. I get paid for something then I have to stretch that money out to pay health insurance/medical costs, union dues, not to mention rent, bills and the occasional piece of pizza. I live in XXXX which is very expensive. I have under {$10000.00} in retirement savings and with streaming media taking away a lot of union work XXXX in commercials things have been getting worse and worse in the last 5 years. Producers and ad agencies don't care about XXXX. There aren't government regs to restrict this from happening and our union is virtually a non factor in protecting our livliehood. I yearn for a night when I can sleep through without waking up in an anxious sweat. I have this {$90000.00} debt hanging over my head with no real possibility to pay it off in my lifetime. I'm wondering how I could have let this happen but more importantly, I'm wondering why there aren't any regulations in place to protect borrowers from this sort of practice. The 'ever polite and supportive bank who says, \" You can have another forbearance, no problem ''. Additionally, had I been told about the \" proper '' repayment plan to be on years ago, I would have a few more years invested in the loan forgiveness program and I would not be staring down this dark tunnel.

I had been told prior I did not qualify for REPAYE, but was not given any solution ( the solution would have been to switch my XXXX loans from IBR to REPAYE early in the process and avoid \" making a change '' penalties '' ) Additionally, I was told I still needed to send in a self certified letter to qualify for IBR, which I had been stalling on so I could gather all this information and do my own research before finalizing it, after becoming aware of all the \" change '' penalties, and having made the unfortunate discovery that Nelnet servicers would tell me something different every time. So come yesterday, somehow I am fully locked into IBR and will need to pay penalties to switch to REPAYE. If I had been given the correct guidance from the very start there would be no 22k penalty, however 3 different loan servicers lead me to believe that IBR was the only way and i was stuck paying a third the balance on IBR with a wildly snowballing principal. I confirmed this fact w the penultimate phone call and NO ONE EVER SAID, hey wait you will avoid having a huge balance in 25 years if you do REPAYE instead.

My only recourse was forbearance or deferment.

The representative asked several questions about my situation and advised to ensure I took out more than enough to cover any costs, as I would have to go through the application process again if I decided I needed more money. \n\nWhen asked what I qualified for, they advised me, with having my mother as a co-signer, I qualified for up to {$20000.00}. This was our qualifying amount with me being XXXX, a XXXX making about {$1100.00} a month and my mother being on social security, making less than {$1000.00} a month, and both with credit scores in the 570-650 range. \n\nOf course me being young and not knowing the long term impacts of this, I accepted. About a year later, when I needed additional funds for school, I reached out to them again, this time still making approximately the same amount of money and having my mom as a co-signer. The company allowed us to take out an additional ( approximate ) {$20000.00}, in addition to allowing my mother to co-sign on a friends student loan for {$30000.00}. \n\nAfter graduating in XXXX, I began receiving collection notices to start repayment. All of the alleged recorded calls will reflect, on numerous occasions attempted to set up a reasonable payment plan, as they were asking for approximately {$550.00} and at this time I was making around $ 1,500.00/month. The declined, were extremely intrusive and disrespectful, also declining to accept anything less than the request amount. \n\nSince I could not afford this amount, I made no payments. In XXXX, I was again contacted by a company servicing the account. After a very long conversation going rounds about why I could not afford what they requested, their initial negotiated amount was nothing less than {$250.00}. I advised I could a maximum afford {$100.00} and advised that was stretching my budget. After the rep consulted with his management, they agreed to $ XXXX/month for 3 months and then said we would reconvene at that time, as I was expecting a promotion and possibly able to afford a little more. When my third payment was made and I spoke to them again, advising my income had not changed, they declined to continue accepting the {$120.00}, insisting on a minimum of {$250.00}. After a lengthy and endless argument, I advised they could take me to court, as no judge was going to order payments for what they requesting, based on my income. \n\nI received no further notice from them until XXXX, when I was contacted by Gurstel Law Firm PC, who now owns the debt. I again attempted to negotiate an amount but they as well were adamant about nothing less than a few hundred a month. Since they refused to work with me, I refused to have further contact. \n\nAt the end of XXXX, Gurstel filed a lawsuit with the XXXX count court in XXXX, AZ. I submitted these concerns to the court as well as requested proof that they even owned the debt, as they are not who I obtained my loan from. The provided proof of ownership and from there I received a few notices of their filings and changes to documents submitted to the court and from there I attempted to contact the attorney handling the lawsuit to discuss options but those calls and emails went unreturned. Magically, the only notices I didn't receive from that point on were the ones that required me to respond to the court or I would receive a notice stating I had 10 days from the date of the document to respond but they were mailed, not served, to me, usually leaving 1-3 days to respond. Additionally, the  XXXX county court requires a {$240.00} filing fee every time I have to respond, to which I requested a fee waiver but was advised I did not meet the financial guidelines and all they could do was allow me 60 days to pay it, of which I could not afford. \n\nAfter that time, in XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice of a request for garnishment, stating I had 10 days to respond, again being mailed to me by XXXX, not the courts and was received on XX/XX/XXXX, with documents dated XX/XX/XXXX. Since I was not provided sufficient time to respond, I contacted the courts after the holidays and was advised I would have to pay the {$240.00} to file a request for a hearing, money of which I did not have. \n\nI received no further notices or calls from XXXX until today XX/XX/XXXX, which is a request for garnishment, documents dated XX/XX/XXXX, post marked XX/XX/XXXX, advising I have 10 days from the date of the letter to respond, of which again I can not afford to do, due to financial hardship. \n\nMy initial request to the courts was a reasonable repayment option, which was never responded to, only the notices of their filings and I have attempted to resolve the matter with XXXX directly. \n\nI am filing this concern with the CFPB for them to be investigated for predatory lending practices as a company and their dealing with the court in this matter, as I believe the convenient timeliness of their notices to me poses a UDAPP violation. However, I have now retained an attorney and will be proceeding with filing a lawsuit for predatory lending practices ( as outlined above, I should have never been given the amount of money I did, nor should they have allowed my mother to co-sign for almost $ 100k,  making less than $ 1k a month, on SSI, which they knew could never be garnished ).",["privat","student","loan","cover","move","move","attend","anoth","colleg","initi","request","call","repres","sever","situat","advis","ensur","took","enough","cover","would","applic","process","decid","money","qualifi","advis","mother","cosign","qualifi","amount","make","month","mother","social","secur","make","less","month","credit","rang","cours","young","know","long","term","accept","year","later","addit","fund","school","time","still","make","approxim","amount","money","cosign","compani","take","addit","approxim","addit","mother","student","loan","graduat","collect","start","repay","reflect","numer","reason","payment","plan","approxim","time","make","around","month","declin","extrem","intrus","disrespect","also","accept","anyth","less","request","amount","sinc","could","afford","amount","made","compani","account","long","convers","go","could","afford","initi","amount","noth","less","advis","could","maximum","afford","advis","budget","manag","agre","said","would","reconven","time","promot","possibl","abl","afford","littl","third","payment","made","spoke","incom","declin","continu","minimum","lengthi","endless","argument","advis","could","take","court","judg","go","order","base","incom","receiv","notic","firm","debt","negoti","amount","well","adam","noth","less","hundr","month","sinc","work","contact","lawsuit","count","court","court","well","proof","even","debt","loan","provid","proof","ownership","receiv","file","court","contact","attorney","handl","lawsuit","discuss","went","unreturn","magic","didnt","receiv","point","respond","court","would","receiv","notic","day","date","document","respond","mail","usual","leav","day","respond","addit","counti","court","file","everi","time","respond","waiver","advis","meet","financi","could","allow","day","could","afford","time","receiv","notic","request","garnish","day","respond","mail","receiv","sinc","provid","suffici","time","respond","advis","would","file","request","hear","money","receiv","today","request","garnish","post","mark","day","date","letter","respond","afford","financi","hardship","initi","request","reason","repay","option","never","file","resolv","matter","direct","file","concern","predatori","compani","deal","court","matter","believ","conveni","timeli","violat","howev","attorney","proceed","file","lawsuit","predatori","outlin","never","given","amount","money","mother","almost","make","less","month","knew","could","never","garnish"]],["The company is asking for additional documentation from the City of XXXX XXXX ( which I have now provided ) and continues not honoring a year of public service - 6 months of which were under the Loan Forgiveness program.",["compani","addit","document","citi","provid","year","public","servic","loan","forgiv","program"]],["I have a loan that originally cost {$6500.00}.

Even more, to compound this grievance, I feel Ive been abandoned by the very same Bureau ( the CFPB ) that was created to serve as my advocate, and tasked by Congress to protect me from such blatant exploitation! \n\nAfter experiencing the aggravation firsthand, over the course of a few years ; after having to deal with the mandates of Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and, particularly, how this is interpreted by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a contracted company the Department of Education has asked to handle the administration and customer service for its PSLF program ), I felt I could sit idly and silently no longer. \n\nThe abbreviated version of events : I was recruited to work for a rural XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ). Part of the recruiting pitch ( and part of the allure ) was that my student debt would be forgiven after ten years of service, if I came to work for them, being that they are a qualified county facility. In other words, if I came to work for them and continued to make my loan payments, whatever balance remained, so I was told, after ten years of service, then that remaining balance would be forgiven. What a recruiting pitch! This sounded great. I did some research into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and sure enough if I worked for a public service-eligible XXXX  ( which this was ) then my debt would be forgiven after 120 payments. So, with this lucrative perk in mind, I accepted the position to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I decided to relocate, dragging my family 1,800 miles across the country, moving from XXXX XXXX to the XXXX XXXX. \n\nI moved in XX/XX/XXXX, and started working the following month. It took from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to be placed into an eligible PSLF repayment program ( 12 months! ). Thats a whole year ; ten percent of the time I was supposed to be working in a qualified environment. For some reason, my spouses employment status prevented me from being put into an eligible program. Why would my husbands employment status be a deciding factor, delaying my enrollment? The program clearly states that I only need to be working at a qualified facility for a requisite length of time ( and be enrolled in a qualified repayment plan ). My husband was out of work when we applied, and this fact somehow disqualified me from consideration! Why? This was the first major red flag that something was amiss, and rotten in the state of XXXX. \n\nAgain, I was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ), to be their full-time XXXX XXXX, working 40 hours a week. I took this position based in part by the false promise of the PSLF program, believing that my student debt would be forgiven after ten years of service/payments I was working at a public service XXXX when I applied for PSLF ; my employer certified the necessary documents immediately. Still, I was denied because I was told they couldnt certify my husbands employer. I told them he was unemployed and nothing but crickets and denials. An entire year went by until I was placed in a PSLF qualified repayment plan. \n\nAnd, how did I finally get accepted? Lo and behold, when my husband was hired to work in XXXX, XXXX, at the end of XX/XX/XXXX then, suddenly, I was approved and enrolled into an eligible PSLF repayment program. HOWEVER, at this time, somehow the proverbial they decided to recalculate how much I would owe on a monthly basis. Based on some unknown algorithm, a figure that determines my households ability to repay, my monthly payments ballooned from {$340.00} a month to {$560.00}. This doesnt sound like a loan forgiveness plan It sounds like, OK let us re-amortize your loan, figure out what amount you need to pay to pay-off the loan in 120 payments, with the service provider grabbing their 33 % markup in profits ( off the interest ). This is a total bait and switch. Its actually mocking me when the PSLF uses the word forgiveness because there isnt a penny thats being forgiven. I am paying off the loan, in its entirety. \n\nThe parameters are clear : Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a federal program that ( supposedly ) forgives federal student loans for borrowers who are employed full-time ( 30+ hours a week ) in an eligible federal, state, or local public service job. Where in this does it stipulate that your spouse must be working? Where does it state that the program will review your households annual income and then determine how much you owe, per month, based on your households financial vitality? Why does this matter? Why should it? The program was established to help certain facilities and regions attract talented candidates this is the spirit that led to the creation of the program. Its supposed to be an added benefit, not an aggravation! \n\nHOW IS IT THAT THIS IS CONSIDERED LOAN FORGIVENESS? \n\nIn other words, heres what the actions of PSLF are stating loudly to me : Go work in public service and qualify for loan forgiveness and then pay nearly seventy thousand dollars on a XXXX XXXX   dollar balance. And, to mock you, we will call this a loan forgiveness. This isnt forgiveness, this is merely paying off a loan in ten years!\n\nThis is blatant bait-and-switch. This is fine print nonsense. There is no loan forgiveness being offered here. This is simply taking a 20-year loan repayment plan and changing it to a 10-year loan payment plan. I never would have moved halfway across the country, moved to a rural community, if I knew this was what the PSLF offered. This spits in the face of the idea of loan forgiveness and betrays the intent behind the creation of such a program to begin with. Again, I ask : how is this a reward for public service?\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of my plight, allow me to expound on the particulars : My name is XXXX XXXX. I graduated, with degree, from the XXXX  XXXX University XXXX program ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX. During my schooling, I amassed approximately {$46000.00} in student loan debt. ( This was a wise investment in my future, on my part, because XXXX   is a fruitful career path with lots of job openings and opportunities ; According to a XXXX report from XXXX, the median annual income for an XXXX was nearly {$82000.00} ). \n\nImmediately after graduation, in XX/XX/XXXX, I began working as an XXXX for a XXXX, XXXX  based XXXX -- XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Then, six months later, I began to make my student debt payments, promptly, after my initial grace period expired. \n\nInitially, I enrolled in the 20-year plan. I did this to keep my payments as low as possible ( even though this repayment plan incurred the biggest interest cost ). I was fine with this, and with paying the enormous interest, because I knowingly entered into this obligation understanding the liability I was taking on. Like I wrote earlier, this was an investment in my future and it was worth it. Sure, I was perplexed to understand a system where the government would loan money to banks at zero percent interest rate, then those banks turn around and lend that money out at interest to students ( to encourage banks to lend money to students for education ). I mean, shouldnt the government simply loan money directly to students, so the government could earn the usury profits, and so students would receive the lowest interest rate possible )? Doesnt that make more sense, for a government of, by, and for the taxpaying people. \n\nFrom XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, over the first 53 months paying back my student loans, I made every monthly payment. My payments were in the {$340.00} range. I paid approximately {$18000.00} over the course of these fifty-three payments ( of which only {$4200.00} went towards principal, and {$14000.00} going towards the interest ). \n\nI moved to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I began working at my new position that XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, for almost 6 months, I was attempting in vain to enroll in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Even though I was eligible, and shouldve qualified without incident, I was denied about three times because there was an apparent issue with my husbands work. When we moved, my husband was no longer employed. He was working full-time in XXXX, at a XXXX XXXX, but when we moved to XXXX  he didnt have employment ( other than XXXX  XXXX work he did, for about 6K a year ). He wrote a letter and said as much, but we still couldnt qualify The PSLF program wouldnt approve my application because of some hiccup with my husband, which to this day I have no idea what the issue was. I was told they couldnt verify employment, even though I constantly told them that my husband wasnt employed ( at the time of my application ). \n\nAnyway, in XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were consolidated from XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Against my wishes, I was enrolled in a program that didnt qualify for the PSLF. My payment was about {$320.00}. I called for the umpteenth time Anyway, that XX/XX/XXXX my husband was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX. And, would you believe, this was when the PSLF program finally approved my application. Now that my husband was working, for some particularly strange reason, the program accepted my application! Why would my husbands employment status determine my eligibility? \nSo, after certifying my employment at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and calibrating what the PSLF deemed I was mandated to pay monthly, I was finally enrolled into the PSLF program in XX/XX/XXXX ( one year after I began the enrollment process ). And, guess what my payments were tallied at {$560.00} dollars a month! What a joke. How is it that this is considered loan forgiveness?\n\nIn essence, 120 payments of {$560.00} comes to about {$67000.00}. When I consolidated my loans into this PSLF program, I owed {$46000.00}. This was more than my original loan amount ( because after 4.5 years of payments, most of my payments when towards paying the interest down ). So, when I accepted the job at a rural XXXX, and got excited when I heard about the PSLF perk, little did I know that loan forgiveness meant paying {$67000.00} over 120 payments to pay off the existing {$46000.00} balance.\n\nChanging the loan from a 20-year payment plan to a 10-year payment plan is not loan forgiveness. At the end of my 120 PSLF payments, altogether, going back to when I first began paying off my debt, I wouldve ended up paying {$85000.00} total in payments, from the time I made my first payment in XX/XX/XXXX. Nearly {$86000.00} dollars on a {$46000.00} loan! \n\nBut, the part that aggravates me most, is the misleading fact that I enrolled in the PSLF program, owing just {$46000.00}, and the PSLF program upped my payments from {$340.00} to {$560.00}. In essence, the program demands that I pay about {$67000.00} over ten years, and has the gall to deem this loan forgiveness. \n\nIn conclusion, contending with the deceitful fine-print and the legalistic tentacles of the program has weakened my faith and trust in the Department of Education in general ( and the student loan industry specifically ). The financial turmoil spawned by the false promise of the PSLF program has directly impacted my familys standard of living, while, on a more personal level, the emotional distress caused by the misleading PSLF propaganda has wreaked havoc on my gastrointestinal tract. Just the mere thought of the programs criminal bait- & -switch violations, no matter when the thought surfaces, irritates me beyond repair. What does this say about the student loan industry? When a GAO report discovers that 99 % of applications have been denied ( 29,000 applications denied! ), I worry about what will happen when I make my 120th payment. Im upset now, after only 30 payments ( only 1/4th of the way thru ) I dont trust the PSLF program, and Im already bracing myself for more trouble when I make my final ( 120th ) payment. I dont trust that the Department of Education will honor their pledge. To be frank, I have zero faith that the PSLF will live up to its obligation. If it took over a year to qualify and enroll in the PSLF repayment service, I fear what awaits for me down the line.",["upon","read","resign","letter","last","former","student","loan","ombudsman","consum","financi","protect","bureau","felt","file","protest","financi","emot","abus","sinc","decid","enrol","depart","public","servic","loan","forgiv","program","even","noth","exercis","futil","whimper","wilder","feel","would","derelict","duti","consum","citizen","didnt","lodg","offici","complaint","record","person","odious","improp","student","loan","program","even","compound","grievanc","feel","abandon","bureau","serv","advoc","congress","protect","blatant","exploit","aggrav","firsthand","cours","deal","public","servic","loan","forgiv","program","particular","contract","compani","depart","educ","handl","administr","custom","servic","program","felt","could","idl","silent","longer","version","work","rural","part","recruit","pitch","part","allur","student","debt","would","servic","came","work","qualifi","counti","facil","came","work","continu","make","loan","whatev","balanc","told","servic","balanc","would","recruit","pitch","great","research","public","servic","loan","forgiv","program","sure","enough","work","public","debt","would","lucrat","perk","mind","accept","posit","decid","reloc","drag","famili","across","countri","move","work","follow","month","took","elig","repay","program","that","whole","year","percent","time","suppos","work","qualifi","environ","reason","employ","status","elig","program","would","employ","status","factor","delay","enrol","program","clear","need","work","qualifi","facil","requisit","length","time","enrol","qualifi","repay","plan","husband","work","appli","fact","somehow","consider","first","major","flag","someth","amiss","rotten","state","hire","work","week","took","posit","base","part","fals","promis","program","believ","student","debt","would","work","public","servic","appli","employ","certifi","necessari","immedi","still","told","certifi","employ","told","unemploy","noth","entir","year","went","qualifi","repay","plan","final","accept","behold","husband","hire","work","sudden","enrol","elig","repay","program","howev","time","somehow","proverbi","decid","recalcul","much","would","month","basi","base","unknown","algorithm","figur","abil","repay","month","month","doesnt","sound","like","loan","forgiv","plan","like","loan","figur","amount","need","payoff","loan","servic","provid","markup","interest","total","bait","switch","actual","word","forgiv","penni","that","pay","loan","entireti","clear","public","servic","loan","forgiv","feder","program","suppos","feder","student","employ","week","elig","feder","state","local","public","servic","stipul","spous","must","work","state","program","review","annual","incom","determin","much","month","base","financi","vital","matter","program","establish","help","certain","attract","talent","spirit","creation","program","suppos","ad","benefit","aggrav","consid","loan","forgiv","loud","work","public","servic","qualifi","loan","forgiv","near","seventi","thousand","dollar","balanc","mock","call","loan","forgiv","forgiv","mere","pay","loan","blatant","fine","print","nonsens","loan","forgiv","simpli","take","year","loan","repay","plan","year","loan","payment","plan","never","would","halfway","across","countri","rural","communiti","knew","face","idea","loan","forgiv","intent","behind","creation","program","begin","reward","public","servic","detail","explan","plight","allow","expound","name","graduat","degre","univers","program","school","approxim","student","loan","debt","wise","invest","futur","part","fruit","career","path","lot","accord","report","median","annual","incom","near","immedi","graduat","work","base","later","make","student","debt","prompt","initi","grace","period","initi","enrol","year","plan","keep","possibl","even","though","repay","plan","biggest","interest","cost","fine","pay","enorm","interest","know","oblig","understand","liabil","take","like","wrote","invest","futur","worth","sure","perplex","understand","system","govern","would","loan","money","zero","percent","interest","rate","turn","around","lend","money","interest","encourag","lend","money","educ","mean","shouldnt","govern","simpli","loan","money","direct","govern","could","earn","usuri","would","receiv","interest","rate","possibl","doesnt","make","sens","govern","taxpay","peopl","first","pay","back","student","made","everi","month","payment","rang","approxim","cours","went","toward","princip","go","toward","interest","work","posit","almost","vain","enrol","public","servic","loan","forgiv","program","even","though","elig","qualifi","without","incid","three","time","appar","issu","work","husband","longer","employ","work","didnt","employ","work","year","wrote","letter","said","much","still","qualifi","program","wouldnt","approv","applic","hiccup","husband","idea","issu","told","verifi","employ","even","though","constant","told","husband","wasnt","employ","time","applic","anyway","consolid","enrol","program","didnt","qualifi","payment","umpteenth","time","anyway","husband","hire","would","believ",

( UAS ), requesting that any additional payment above the monthly due amount on the account be applied to principle. Upon requesting a confirmation number, the UAS employee told me that no confirmation number is generated for this type of request. The latest statement that we received regarding this account indicated that the XXXX payment, posted on XX/XX/2019, was all applied to interest. UAS was asked to correct the XXXX transaction and ensure future payments are applied correctly. Upon receiving a statement dated XX/XX/2019, I realized that payments were not applied correctly and contacted UAS again.

I did this early to ensure that there were no issues as I am working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I have been on repayment plans in the past, have always had my documentation in early, and have always made my payments on time or early. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I made my first payment on my IBR plan of {$260.00}. XXXX. Then, one month later, my account balance was suddenly {$760.00}. XXXX. I emailed them on roughly XX/XX/XXXX, two weeks prior to the due date asking what was going on. I waited two weeks and never received a response. \n\nWhen I called them roughly around XX/XX/XXXX to clarify, they told me that I had a second IBR application for my graduate loans that needed income verification. Despite having income verification already on record, I immediately submitted additional income verification and asked for them to process it on the phone. They refused, claiming that I had to wait 20 days for it to be processed. After sitting on the phone for an hour waiting to speak to a supervisor, I had to leave. I was informed I could not leave the supervisor a message and would not receive a call back from a supervisor because my situation \" wasn't serious enough. '' At no point prior to this was it made clear to me that there were two separate IBR applications going. I was approved on XX/XX/XXXX for IBR payments and my understanding was that I was completely finished with the process. It does not make sense that I would only want IBR for my undergraduate loans, which are half the cost of the graduate loans. I never filed two separate applications so I do not understand how my one application and proof of income that should have covered all of my loans was split into two separate applications or why I had to submit an additional proof of income to get the second processed when one was already on file with them. \n\nDuring this call, I explained that I could not afford that payment and was angry that this was even the situation. The customer service representative suggested a forbearance until the application was processed. I was not happy that this would be on my credit when I had done my part in supplying the application for IBR and the related income verification back in XXXX. However, I saw no choice and did the forbearance. My understanding of forbearance was that it was the same as a deferment and my income would be verified and I could resume making IBR payments with the {$500.00} removed from my account. I even made the {$260.00} payment for my already established IBR application so that I would not have to miss a month towards PSLF. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received verification that I was now on an income-based repayment plan of {$280.00}. I saw that the {$500.00} was still on my account and assumed they were in the process of removing it. When I went to make my payment, I was told that if it went on the {$500.00}, I would have to pay the full {$500.00}. My understanding was that as part of forbearance, I would be required to pay the full amount if I paid any amount on the forbearance. It was at no point clearly explained to me what forbearance meant or that I was still responsible for this {$500.00}. I even called back because I could not cancel the payment as it already went through and I requested that they put that payment on the next IBR payment instead as that was the amount I paid. My understanding upon talking to them was I was still under forbearance for the month of XXXX so I asked them to apply the payment to the month of XXXX. The woman I spoke to told me she would do this, but she did not do this. So, with the understanding that my payment for XXXX was under forbearance and my payment for XXXX was covered, I did not make an additional payment in XXXX. \n\nThen I received a phone call stating on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX that I had a message on my account and when I checked this my account says I owe {$780.00} and am 47 days behind on a payment and threatened me with collections.

I called my husband and by that point in time he had been on their website and found many options articulated, entered the information and the monthly payment went down even further than what the lowest one was ... again ... this is crazy.

I was told by the customer service representative that this was not possible since Navient did not service my loans prior to XXXX. I asked for an accounting of the amount that was acquired by Navient in XXXX and a complete accounting from that date. I was told by the customer service rep that I would receive the accounting via mail within 2 weeks. Subsequently, the accounting was never received via mail or electronic mail. \nI was also told by the customer service represenative that when Navient acquired my loans they were in a \" repayment plan of forbearance ''. I explained to the customer service rep that \" forbearance '' is a loan status and not a \" repayment plan ''. I was trying to understand why the repayment plan I had selected with my prior provider ( 15 years graduated repayment ), did not carry with the loan acquisition by Navient. This information has still not been provided. Rather I was told repeatedly by the customer service representative that the \" repayment plan was forbearance ''. \nI have since re-finance my loan with a private servicer since Navient could never provide a clear accounting or transparency into how my payments were applied. \nSuccessful resolution of this issue would be a complete accounting of how all payments were applied by Navient. In addition, I would like information on the balances as bought and sold from XXXX to Navient. I have checked the federal student loan database for this information, but there does not appear to be any record of payments applied, only amounts bought and sold between corporations in the submarket.",["inquir","payment","histori","student","initi","privat","feder","student","repay","year","gradual","step","repay","plan","initi","consolid","includ","graduat","student","servic","provid","switch","subsequ","acquir","around","made","sever","lump","allow","direct","loan","choic","rather","appli","even","across","privat","feder","tri","understand","complet","loan","payment","histori","reason","amount","origin","despit","phone","complet","histori","made","told","custom","servic","repres","possibl","sinc","servic","prior","account","amount","acquir","complet","account","date","told","custom","servic","would","receiv","account","mail","within","subsequ","account","never","receiv","mail","electron","mail","also","told","custom","servic","acquir","repay","plan","forbear","custom","servic","forbear","loan","status","repay","plan","tri","understand","repay","plan","select","prior","provid","graduat","repay","carri","loan","acquisit","inform","still","provid","rather","told","repeat","custom","servic","repres","repay","plan","forbear","sinc","refin","loan","privat","sinc","could","never","provid","clear","account","transpar","appli","success","resolut","issu","would","complet","account","appli","addit","would","like","inform","bought","sold","check","feder","student","loan","inform","appear","record","appli","bought","sold"]],["I was told by a navient representative that if I made XXXX on time payments and sent in all the proper information that I could get my co-signer released.

I chose this option because the cost of my rent, car and household bills took up most of my low income. My payment was around {$100.00} and I faithfully paid it every month. After 4 years my payment NEVER decreased. I was only covering interest, and was charged hundreds of dollars in capitalized interest each year. \nIt is clear that they were pushing students to choose this plan to make the company more money in interest. Why would navient include a payment plan that would never pay off your loan? Because it was more money in their pocket. \n\n-Once I realized what was happening with the income driven plans, I switched to a graduated plan and began throwing any extra money I had toward my loans. The website has an option to allocate where extra payments go. I chose to tackle the highest interest loan and was putting all my additional payments toward that. There is also a place on the website to tell navient to either push out your due date when extra payments are made, or keep billing you the monthly amount. I specifically checked off the box to have them continue billing me for my monthly amount. However, over the years I have had to call and complain because they ignore this request and advance my due date on some loans. \nI believe they advance the due date on some loans so they will be able to charge capitalized interest. \n\n\n-The most recent issue I had was when I decided to go back to school to get my masters. My company paid for me to take a class, and I did not opt for any financial aid. I did not request for ANYTHING about my XXXX loans to change. A month into taking this class, I got a letter from Navient saying that my loans had been put into deferment because I was a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I DID NOT REQUEST OR APPROVE THIS. I had to call Navient to request they take my loans out of deferment. A month later I was charged {$61.00} in capitalized interest, despite having paid {$600.00} extra payments every month for 6 months. During the phone call I was told that the {$61.00} was for the 15 days that my loans were in deferment. That 15 days was the time it took for them to send me a letter informing me of the deferment. I check the website weekly, and it never said I was in deferment anywhere online. \nI also found out during this phone call that they had again been moving my payment due date a month forward with each extra payment I made. Therefore, some of my loans were accruing the capitalized interest WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE even though I had specially checked off the do not advance my monthly payment on the website. The woman on the phone told me that their system did not have it checked off. \n\nI am extremely frustrated with this company, and I worry for those new graduates who might naively assume that their minimum payments are making a difference in their loans. Students are trusting this company to handle their payments correctly, and Navient continues to cheat us out of thousands of dollars. Their communication is unclear and inconsistent. I now fully read my entire statement every month and compare it to my online account to make sure the information is correct. It almost never is. Something needs to be done to give students a fair chance at loan repayment. \n\n\nThank you for your time, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NH",["hello","incred","concern","handl","student","loan","current","share","sinc","graduat","graduat","repay","incom","driven","repay","plan","chose","option","cost","rent","household","took","incom","payment","around","faith","everi","month","payment","never","cover","interest","interest","year","clear","push","choos","plan","make","compani","money","interest","would","includ","payment","plan","would","never","loan","money","pocket","happen","incom","driven","switch","graduat","plan","throw","extra","money","toward","option","alloc","extra","chose","tackl","highest","interest","loan","addit","toward","also","place","tell","either","push","date","extra","made","keep","bill","month","amount","specif","check","continu","bill","month","amount","howev","call","complain","ignor","request","advanc","date","believ","advanc","date","abl","charg","interest","recent","issu","decid","back","school","compani","take","class","financi","request","anyth","chang","month","take","class","letter","say","defer","request","approv","call","request","take","defer","month","later","interest","despit","extra","everi","month","phone","call","told","day","defer","day","time","took","send","letter","defer","check","week","never","said","defer","anywher","also","found","phone","call","move","payment","date","month","forward","extra","payment","made","therefor","interest","without","knowledg","even","though","special","check","advanc","month","payment","woman","phone","told","system","check","extrem","compani","worri","might","naiv","assum","minimum","make","differ","trust","compani","handl","correct","cheat","communic","unclear","inconsist","fulli","read","entir","statement","everi","month","compar","account","make","sure","inform","correct","almost","never","someth","need","done","give","fair","chanc","loan","repay","thank","time"]],["I am currently receiving government assistance food benefits, health insurance, and cash benefits.

She stated to call back after my next paycheck to check the balance. I called 2 weeks later and was advised that I only owed apprx. {$80.00}. I inquired if {$80.00} would be the amount taken out and was advised I would have to call my HR department and advise them to adjust the amount. I contacted my HR department and was advised that they are required by law to take 15 % of my disposable income until they received notification that the loan was satisfied. I called XXXX back and was advised that a letter had been sent to my employer advising of the adjusted amount. The final deduction was made for apprx {$290.00}.

I asked how could I be charged interest on a mistake that was not made by me nor was I notified of error.

She stated that since my account was in default my finance charges are higher than normal. I asked again how can I be charged finance charges for mistakes not made by me. I asked why wasnt i informed of any of this. I at this point I had received 1 phone call with no message left, 0 letters, 0 emails and 0 text.

Upon reviewing my credit score it has been reported from your company as a derogatory account. This has impacted my score in a negative way. This is a formal notice that your claim is disputed. \n\n\nI am requesting validation, made pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, along with the corresponding local state laws.

I had made an attempt to pay my student loan debt in XX/XX/XXXX but fell victim to an online scam and all of payments throughout the course of that year were never given to your company. Unfortunately this is money that i lost and will never receive restitution for. I payed a company called XXXX XXXX {$49.00} /month for one year thinking that payment was going towards all my loans which were then consolidated. After this realization i attempted to again to apply for the Income Based Repayment Program and i was given a deferment. \n\nI have been diligently making attempts to pay all my debts and improve my credit score for the past two years to best of ability. I am attempting to make my account with your company current, and doing so I am sending my application for the Income Based repayment Plan.

In order to achieve certification for a second job which will increase my annual gross income so that i may pay off my debt faster once employed at this second place of employment. Again I have been monitoring my credit closely and making all attempts to the best of my capabilities to pay all debts with my available funds. \n\nPlease Note : Because of my separation and then divorce i could not file my taxes for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX due to the fact that i was employed by my ex-husband as an independent XXXX at his Tattoo Studio ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) throughout the course of the marriage. This business was owned by him and premarital. Our taxes were always filed as separate but married throughout the course of the marriage which was XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX when divorce was granted. He had with held financial documents that contained my earnings. This was part of our divorce proceedings and wasnt resolved untilXX/XX/XXXX. I have since filed for those years and i am enclosing my XX/XX/XXXX tax return as well for review of my XXXX application. \n\nPlease also be aware that any negative mark found on my credit reports ( including XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) from your company or any company that you represent, for a debt that I dont owe, is a violation of the FCRA & FDCPA ; therefore if you can not validate the debt, you must request that all credit reporting agencies delete the entry. \nPending the outcome of my investigation of any evidence that you submit, you are instructed to take no action that could be detrimental to any of my credit reports. \nFailure to respond within 30 days of receipt of this certified letter may result in small claims legal action against your company at my local venue.

With my XXXX education costing double what my XXXX and XXXX degrees COMBINED cost and now rendering it useless, I think XXXX is in breach of contract and that loan debt should be transferred to XXXX. Please see my below statement for my experience with XXXX University, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \n\n\nWhile I am a graduate of XXXX with an XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX increasingly negative reputation and press has rendered my degree worthless. In light of the recent campus closures ( I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX campus ), the integrity of my degree has been severely impacted and will no doubt, have a profound impact on my future employment opportunities at the XXXX level. \n\nFortunately, I earned my XXXX XXXX from an accredited state school program that has allowed me to find employment at the XXXX level. In the process of onboarding to this position, I was advised by my current HR department that my XXXX degree could not be verified so I was hired ( and paid ) at the XXXX XXXX level. They use the XXXX XXXX   Database for degree verification and XXXX is not listed, therefore, my XXXX degree is not recognized and has not been valuable or useful to me in that regard. \n\n\nWhen I enrolled in XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, I feel I was misled in how XXXX presented its credentials and academic rigor and felt extreme pressure to accept admissions immediately. I learned of XXXX program through an XXXX Board Member ( who was one of my graduate school professors ) who said he could \" get me in '' and wrote a letter of recommendation on my behalf. \nThroughout the admissions process, their recruiter led me to believe that there were admission standards and hurdles that I was clearing, and pressed me to make a decision swiftly. \n\n\nDuring the admissions process, I inquired about XXXX accreditation and was told they were in the process of renewing it and expressed confidence that it would be reinstated shortly. I don't believe XXXX ever accredited my program. I was rushed into making a decision and fast tracked to the financial aid department. At several points during my education, I expressed concerns to the department chair ( who was literally a different person every year as it appeared they could not retain faculty for more than a year ), I was told that the onus of responsibility fell on me to understand licensure requirements and I could not get an answer as to whether or not the program would be sufficient for licensure. At the time that I enrolled in XXXX in XXXX, it had a decent reputation, but it quickly became clear to me, as well as other faculty I was working with, that XXXX changing policies and standards were unsavory. After the negative press of XXXX, in which XXXX was targeted for predatory lending and admissions practices, I knew that I had become involved with an institution with a tainted reputation. I attempted to transfer but learned that my 3 years of coursework would not be accepted and was advised to quickly complete the program, which I did. \n\n\nI am furious about the amount of debt I have accrued with a degree that held little value then, but now has no value in light of XXXX 's recent campus closures. I can not see any legitimate hiring agency recognizing my advanced degree coming from XXXX ; I don't see how I will be able to work in the field at the XXXX level. \n\n\nI am an intelligent person and not easily taken advantage of, yet in hindsight, I feel embarrassed and angry that I find myself in this situation. I am in need of guidance and help to address my current concerns. I have over $ 100k in student loan debt from XXXX alone, double what I accrued from my XXXX and XXXX degrees combined. It was an incredibly expensive program that failed to deliver what was promised - an accredited program that would prepare me for licensure at the XXXX level. I am ashamed that my name is associated with this institution and will have to eliminate it from my resumes and curriculum vitae to spare my reputation that I have worked so hard to establish. It is completely unjust that XXXX can close and leave a wake of student and alumni victims feeling angry and helpless. I can not obtain my transcripts and course catalogs to verify my coursework, yet I am neck deep in loan debt that I can not begin to chip away at. \n\nNow that XXXX is closed and again in the news, I do not think that I can attach my name and professional reputation to this program and be taken seriously as a XXXX. Incidentally, I worked as the XXXX County XXXX for 9 years, developing a sound reputation within the community. I left to pursue academia where I quickly learned that the academic world does not recognize XXXX as a legitimate institution and have been pursuing employment at the XXXX level. \n\n\nI was encouraged by the XXXX XXXX XXXX to reach out to my local congressional office to seek some support and hope that Congress can establish some means to protect XXXX victims.",["complaint","univers","reput","recent","campus","think","absorb","cost","educ","interest","concern","degre","useless","frequent","contact","lender","never","abl","afford","payment","loan","debt","interest","rate","interest","leav","littl","chanc","ever","principl","educ","cost","doubl","combin","cost","render","useless","think","breach","contract","loan","debt","transfer","pleas","statement","experi","univers","graduat","increas","negat","reput","press","degre","worthless","light","recent","campus","campus","integr","degre","sever","impact","doubt","profound","impact","futur","employ","level","fortun","accredit","state","school","program","find","employ","level","process","posit","advis","current","depart","degre","could","hire","level","degre","verif","list","therefor","degre","valuabl","use","regard","enrol","feel","misl","academ","rigor","felt","extrem","pressur","accept","immedi","learn","program","board","member","graduat","school","said","could","wrote","letter","recommend","behalf","throughout","process","recruit","believ","admiss","clear","make","decis","process","accredit","told","process","express","confid","would","short","dont","believ","ever","accredit","program","rush","make","decis","fast","track","financi","depart","sever","educ","express","depart","chair","liter","differ","person","everi","year","could","retain","faculti","year","told","onus","respons","fell","understand","licensur","could","answer","whether","program","would","suffici","licensur","time","enrol","decent","reput","quick","clear","well","faculti","work","unsavori","negat","press","target","predatori","knew","becom","involv","institut","reput","transfer","learn","would","accept","advis","quick","complet","program","furious","amount","debt","degre","littl","valu","valu","light","recent","campus","legitim","agenc","advanc","degre","come","dont","abl","work","field","level","intellig","person","easili","taken","advantag","hindsight","feel","embarrass","angri","find","situat","need","guidanc","help","address","current","student","loan","debt","alon","doubl","combin","incred","expens","program","deliv","accredit","program","would","prepar","licensur","level","asham","name","associ","institut","elimin","curriculum","spare","reput","work","hard","establish","complet","unjust","close","leav","wake","student","alumni","feel","angri","helpless","obtain","cours","verifi","neck","deep","loan","debt","begin","chip","away","close","news","think","attach","name","profession","reput","program","taken","serious","incident","work","counti","sound","reput","within","communiti","left","pursu","quick","learn","academ","world","recogn","legitim","institut","employ","level","reach","local","congression","offic","seek","support","hope","congress","establish","protect"]],["nAVIENT HAS MIS-ALLOCATED MY PAYMENTS.

I started working with a loan officer last year and paid to have someone help me fix things on my credit. The loan officer told me that i needed to get my student loans in good standings because with them in default in wouldn't qualify for any home loan having a student loan in default. So back in XX/XX/2018 I contacted immediate credit recovery to see what i needed to do to get my student loans in good standings so that i could be eligible to get my home loan. They told me that i could do a rehabilitation loan and after 9 months of consecutive payments then the loans would not be considered in default any longer and it would be shown in good standings and then i would be able to get my home loan because it wouldnt be considered a student loans in default. So i setup and sent in the documentation that they required and then every month they would send me a reminder that said the {$5.00} will come out this day. So my sister has given me the 9 months to get that in good standings so that i would be eligible to have the house in my name. The loan officer has all the paperwork that i needed to get in order to close on the house. One of the required Documents was a document from immediate credit recovery showing the account numbers and the rehabilitation amount. Well i called immediate credit recovery and told them what i needed, the first person that i talked to told me that the rehabilitation was only on 2 of my loans and the other 6 were not eligible. So i said no that must be a mistake, there would be no reason i told the lady to rehab 2 of my loans while the other 6 were still in default. That would still block me from getting a home loan and make absolutely no sense for me to have done that and have waited 9 months. She agreed and then said well i would have to listen to the phone call to determine if i was mislead to believe that it was for all of my loans and not just 2 of them. After a couple days of calling back she had finally listened to the original phone call and said that she apologized that i was not made aware that the rehabilitation was only for the 2 loans, she said that this was a mistake and i should have been told 2 were going to be out of default but i still had 6 loans also serviced by them that were going to be considered negative. Every month the {$5.00} letter i received would say total amount due at the top and would have like {$64000.00}. The lady said im not sure how i can make this right all i can offer you is a consolidation of all your loans at this point. I feel like they mislead me from the beginning and that should have been offered in the beginning, or should have even mentioned that it was only for a couple of the loans.

I have all the approvals for the home loan and was supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX, but now having 6 student loans in default still i will not be able to get the home loan and will be put out of my home. So i tried to fill out the consolidation to see if there is any way that would help my situation after being mislead for 9 months, but they gave me the wrong amounts of the loans that i needed to consolidate and they gave me the wrong account numbers as well. So im not sure if in the beginning they included all the loans only to find out that 2 were eligible and just didnt tell me but the fact of the matter is they made a mistake either in the beggining or when i called 3 weeks ago for the account numbers of the loans, and then they realized that i had been told misleading incorrect information. In the end they can apologize and that still doesnt help me keep my home, someone needs to be held accountable and they should not be able to mislead anyone else into something that is not what was even asked for. They should not be able as a debt collector to not provide me with false or inaccurate information with no repercussions in the end. The lady from immediate credit that i spoke with said that she had reported the issue to whomever that may be, however that does not help me now.",["financ","home","live","name","get","marri","need","home","name","work","loan","offic","last","year","someon","help","credit","loan","offic","told","student","good","default","wouldnt","qualifi","home","loan","student","loan","default","back","immedi","credit","recoveri","student","good","could","elig","home","loan","told","could","rehabilit","loan","consecut","would","consid","default","longer","would","shown","good","would","abl","home","loan","wouldnt","consid","student","default","setup","sent","document","everi","month","would","send","remind","said","come","sister","given","good","would","elig","hous","name","loan","offic","order","close","hous","document","immedi","credit","recoveri","show","account","rehabilit","amount","well","immedi","credit","recoveri","told","first","person","told","rehabilit","elig","said","must","mistak","would","reason","told","ladi","still","default","would","still","block","get","home","loan","make","absolut","sens","done","agre","said","well","would","listen","phone","call","determin","mislead","believ","coupl","day","call","back","final","origin","phone","call","said","made","awar","rehabilit","said","mistak","told","go","default","still","also","go","consid","negat","everi","month","letter","receiv","would","total","amount","would","like","ladi","said","sure","make","right","offer","consolid","point","feel","like","mislead","begin","begin","even","coupl","sister","go","sell","home","live","home","home","loan","suppos","close","student","default","still","abl","home","loan","home","tri","fill","consolid","would","help","situat","mislead","gave","wrong","consolid","gave","wrong","account","well","sure","begin","includ","find","elig","didnt","tell","fact","matter","made","mistak","either","account","told","mislead","incorrect","inform","apolog","still","doesnt","help","keep","home","someon","need","account","abl","mislead","anyon","els","someth","even","abl","debt","collector","provid","fals","inaccur","inform","ladi","immedi","credit","spoke","said","issu","whomev","howev","help"]],["This school was closed recently in 2018.

I am reporting on both companies - namely to complaint about a systematic effort on their part to provide misleading and incomplete information about the multitudinous forbearances and deferments granted by these two lenders to the primary borrower on 2 loans where I am listed as the co-signer. Even when explicitly requested information about these deferments/forbearances in writing, including information about terms and timeframe, Sallie Mae and now Navient have both withheld this information or refused to comply with the requests. This meant for over 1 years I had little information about the types of forbearances that these two were providing and whether they had made any effort whatsoever to offer less expensive payment plans - ones that dont cause the loans to balloon in size during periods of reduced payments. These reduced payments did not make possible for the borrower to be able to request a co-signer release after over a year of on-time payments, but they netted both Sallie Mae and Navient a significant profit. Recently I have been in touch with agent XXXX XXXX at Navient was the most recent individual at Navient to provide false and incomplete information about these loans. 3 months ago she had notified me that Navient had provided the borrower - XXXX XXXX - with yet another reduced payment forebearance but would not disclose the terms. It seems that Navient is intent on ensuring that the borrower would never be able to be eligible for a co-signer release and thats shes eager to have me back take over payments : in short, they fail to provide the borrower with a payment plan that actually pay off the loan, but instead allows it to increase in size as her reduced payments dont even cover interest. XXXX did disclose that Navient continued to allow the borrower to make below-interest payments as she took out new loans. If the borrower had the capacity to borrow more, then she didnt need a forebearance, and the granting of these to the borrower over and over again is meant simply to boost its profits at my expense. 3 months XXXX ago did say only that the borrower was to make 3 payments and then her account would no longer be past due. However, several days after the 3rd scheduled payment, Navient sent me another past due notice demanding payment for her loan. In short, Navient had lied again. \n\nId like to know why Navient continues to lie to me and why they continue to push these pointless forebearances on the the borrower that simply balloon the loan when not only does Navient know that she had recklessly borrowed since she first nearly defaulted on these loans, but that the borrower has NEVER made a single regular payment on these 2 loans, one of which Im now paying. The borrower has shown Navient that the borrower doesnt use forebearances to get back on her feet and be able to make regular monthly payments. No. She uses them to cause me the co-signer to be on the hook for more, as Navient profits. I charge that Navient has been and continue to collude with the borrower irresponsibly to rake in profit when it knows full well from her payment history alone that she has absolutely no intention to use these forebearances to be able to make regular payments that qualify for co-signer release. \n\nI also filed multiple fraud complaints that she signed these loans in my name but neither Sallie Mae nor Navient accepted them. They simply dismissed them. But she still committed fraud.",["origin","lender","current","name","complaint","systemat","effort","part","provid","mislead","incomplet","inform","multitudin","primari","borrow","list","cosign","even","explicit","inform","write","inform","withheld","inform","compli","meant","littl","inform","provid","whether","made","effort","whatsoev","offer","less","expens","payment","dont","caus","balloon","size","reduc","reduc","make","possibl","borrow","abl","request","cosign","releas","year","net","signific","profit","recent","touch","agent","recent","individu","provid","fals","incomplet","inform","notifi","provid","borrow","anoth","reduc","payment","would","disclos","intent","borrow","would","never","abl","elig","cosign","releas","that","eager","back","take","short","fail","provid","borrow","payment","plan","actual","loan","instead","increas","size","reduc","dont","even","cover","interest","disclos","continu","allow","borrow","make","took","borrow","capac","borrow","didnt","need","borrow","meant","simpli","boost","expens","borrow","make","account","would","longer","past","howev","sever","day","payment","sent","anoth","past","notic","demand","payment","loan","short","lie","like","know","continu","push","pointless","borrow","simpli","balloon","loan","know","reckless","sinc","first","near","borrow","never","made","singl","regular","payment","pay","borrow","shown","borrow","doesnt","back","abl","make","regular","month","caus","cosign","hook","charg","continu","collud","borrow","irrespons","rake","profit","full","well","payment","histori","alon","absolut","intent","abl","make","regular","qualifi","cosign","releas","also","multipl","fraud","name","neither","accept","simpli","still","fraud"]],["This is a federal student loan that was taken over by Nelnet mid-XXXX from XXXX. \nWhen I was checking my credit report today it stated that this loan is in forbearance as of XX/XX/XXXX.

The increase seems excessive, as based on the 10 % of gross income formula the correct amount would be much closer to {$590.00}. \n\nYour company has deliberately withheld the necessary information for getting that recalculation done for MONTHS, ignored my letter to do so and ample information regarding my current income, and continued to overcharge me. I am including a new IBR request and a copy of a recent paycheck. You will IMMEDIATELY recalculate my IBR based on my actual income, as you have been asked to do multiple times over the last few months. \n\nI live in XXXX, which currently has one of the highest costs of living in the nation, and can not be expected to sit by quietly while you take more than your due. I have never missed a payment to anyone who has held my loans ( including XXXX XXXX, who dispersed my loans to debt collectors rather than obey the laws regarding IBR ), and except for a few brief deferments have been paying steadily since the year XXXX. I would like to know when I might reasonably expect loan forgiveness from Navient, as it is usually offered after 20-25 years. \n\nAnd, by law, you only have a right to only 15 % of my DISCRETIONARY income ( which amounts to approximately $ XXXXmonth after expenses ), and NOT 15 % or greater of my gross income, you will abide by the law, and immediately adjust the IBR amount down to the expected amount. I am happy to provide receipts as required to prove the amount of my discretionary income.\n\nKindly respond in writing, so that I may share your answer with all those I have Ccd on this letter.

Per Navient, these loans are now no longer eligible for in-school deferment. They say that each of these loans have a stipulated maximum of 48 months of in-school deferment. I dont recall this being vocalized to me at the time of origination but that was a long time ago. These loans did not have a co-signor. \n\nWhat makes this story so egregious is that I also have newer loans through Navient that were from when I attended a XXXX XXXX program   at XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ) with the aim of attending XXXX school. \n\nPrior to attending the XXXX XXXX program, I called Navient and asked about the possibility of obtaining private loans after voicing that my goal was to attend XXXX school. I sought these loans because I did not qualify for federal loans for the post-baccalaureate program. I told Navient about my goal of attending XXXX school and that I needed to take the science prerequisites prior to applying to XXXX school. I also asked if these loans or my goal of attending XXXX school would be negatively impacted/influenced by the loans I already had with them. Navient said they could certainly help me out with the private education loans, but at no time did Navient ever tell me that my private education loans from XXXX University would start to become ineligible for in-school deferment half-way through XXXX school. \n\nFurther, I applied for these private loans through Navient for three consecutive years, XXXX, for this XXXX XXXX program. In every application, that was filled out by Navient with me on the phone, when I was asked what my educational aspirations were and reasons for the loan, I always told them that I needed these private education loans because I wanted to attend XXXX school  and these loans were for a XXXX XXXX   program. At no time did Navient ever tell me that my private education loans from XXXX University would start to become ineligible for in-school deferment half-way through XXXX school. If I had been told about this, I might have not attended the XXXX XXXX program and XXXX school. \n\nSo here I am ; attending XXXX school and out of the work force. I am now told I can no longer receive in-school deferment for these loans. I am stuck. Navient has asked me if I can get a job to which I replied : XXXX school students are not allowed to work. Further, I have no recent work experience needed to secure a job. I have an apartment lease that I may have to break now, with further financial penalties, because I may have to drop out of XXXX   school and somehow find a job. I feel tricked. I feel like I was setup to fail. \n\nAt the beginning of last week ( XX/XX/19 ) someone at Navient submitted, on my behalf, a special extension application for in-school deferment but that was denied by Navient at the end of last week. My school, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, has called Navient on my behalf and Navient said the same thing : that these loans are now no longer eligible for in-school deferment. When I stated everything that had transpired above about my asking Navient prior to attending the XXXX XXXXe program and if I could receive private loans for the program and if they saw a problem with me attending XXXX school ( to which Navient said there was no problem and that they could help ), Navient said the same thing again : that these loans are now no longer eligible for in-school deferment. \n\nThe funny thing is that if I had already graduated from XXXX school, and already in a residency program, I could potentially qualify to have my payments postponed. \n\nXXXX website does not say anything about how many months of in-school deferment are left for each loan. Nor is there anywhere on XXXX website where I can even read the full loan contract that would state this, not that I would even know to check about this because Ive never heard of this before.

This really caught my attention when my tax refund was taken by this company. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX EST, I made a phone call to clear up the situation with the National Credit Services.

I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is \" A big mess '', and it is by no fault of yours. '' I understand that the loans now must go to the \" XXXX XXXX '' and there is no timeline for the \" mess '' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. \nThe numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application \" baits '' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided \" false '' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly. \nThere are many more occasions in which I have been provided false information and guidance, including information regarding the XXXX program. Obviously, Fed Loan Servicing reps have no accountability, and/or competence regarding protocols in any department. I have managed to get through, and have coped with the undue stress and excessive time and aggravation involved in managing my student loans, but default, I can not deal with! This is unbearable, and is negatively affecting my health. I am seeking legal advice. Thankfully, I have documented my calls since XXXX, with employee ID numbers. \nI am a XXXX XXXX XXXX.

When I contacted them, in XX/XX/XXXX and requested assistance in the form of refinancing due to an increase in my credit score, they refused and instead they placed me on an interest only repayment plan for {$300.00} a month, despite the fact that my cosigner had amazing credit. After that, they would make disrespectful, harassing and occasionally threatening calls to myself and my cosigner, who was in the hospital during one of  these calls. While I understand that they are a business, these calls came when I was only two days late in payment, and when I had already called XXXX XXXX and informed them that I was waiting on a paycheck and then they would get their money. At one point, the person I spoke with talked down to me and told me that until I \" learned to pay on time, I would continue getting the calls.

When I was receiving the letters, I was never told that Navient owned XXXX. When I requested my loan promissory notes, they told me to do it online, yet you can not.

I received a text message from fedloan stating In order for my Income repayment plan to be considered I needed to upload supporting documents so I called in twice, once in XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX regarding this uploaded paystub ; I notified the reps each time that I had already submitted the paystub and each time it was confirmed they could see the paystub.On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification the consolidation was completed with no mention of the income repayment plan. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another text from XXXX stating my payment is coming due on XX/XX/XXXX, etc. so I logged into my account to see why I had a payment due when I had applied for a repayment based on my unemployment.

I said I did not want my loan in deferment. The Navient rep told me that while I was in school my loan would be in deferment and I did not have to make payments while it was in deferment. Again I said I don't want my loan in deferment. I asked how can this be resolved? The Navient rep had no answer for me. I called back again to talk with another rep who gave me the same story.

I could have continued to make IBR payments, I needed to call another phone number to request a deferment cancellation and reapply for an IBR plan.\n\nXXXX XXXX who now has my loan and has taken a year so far to process Navients payments. XXXX has said that they needed to carefully look at each one to make sure it was processed correctly and is a qualifying payment. There automated system only found 6 qualifying payments, there are 31 more payments that need to be looked at more closely by hand. These payments may or may not be qualifying.\n\nAdditionally, Navient told me that I didnt have to fill out any paperwork to apply for the loan forgiveness program. I asked several times in the 5 years. They said I just needed to make IBR payments for 10 years and my loan will be forgiven. I found out from a co-worker that I should have submitted an application for the student loan forgiveness. When I talked to Navient about this form they gave me the number for XXXX  and told me that XXXX handle the processing of this form. Navient rep also said that I didn't have to fill out this form but it was a good idea. They also made it seem like XXXX just processed these applications. I realize after filling out the online application and paperwork that my loan was being transferred from Navient to XXXX and that XXXX was another loan handler.\n\nProblems I am having -- Problem 1 -- I missed a year of payments because Navient told me that I couldnt make IBR payments while I was in deferment and that I couldnt get out of deferment while I was in school. This was incorrect. I could have been one year closer to being finished with these loans. And if I get stuck with this loan because Navient didn't process my payments correctly I'm paying a years worth of interest on top of that.

Something has to be done, this seems unconstitutional like im being robbed because i spent a period of time in school trying to better my education, when in reality all these loans have done is allow Navient to place be in Debt that I will never ever be able to pay off.

Sallie Mae took over my Direct Loans without my approval inXX/XX/2012. In XX/XX/2012 I received a bill for {$1200.00} that did not reflect my Income Based payment plan that I was on with Direct Loans. I called to have my bill recalculated based upon my income and I was eventually told my new payment would be {$390.00}. The representative also stated my first payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX so I made my payment early on XX/XX/XXXX. The following month I received a bill for {$410.00} and paid it in full. The next month it dropped to {$400.00}. I have found out through XXXX that this payment does not count toward my 120 payments because the payment was not for the full amount. \nI can only assume the customer service representative only saw the payment for loan # XXXX and did not include Loan # XXXX. At the time I was not aware they were separate loans. I paid the amount she instructed me to. As you can verify from my payment history I have always made my loan payments in full and on time. I made my payment in good faith for the amount I was told was due. Obviously if the representative would have told me to pay an additional {$12.00} I would have done it. Unfortunately they did not provide a written statement reflecting the new amount due so I made my payment based upon their employees verbal statement of the amount due. I have submitted documents proving my case. Document 1 shows the original payment due of {$1200.00}. XXXX that did not reflect my correct IBR plan. Doc 2 clearly shows my payment of {$390.00}, no amount past due, and a XXXX payment due of {$390.00}. ( apparently this was an additional statement error that was then changed to {$410.00} ). Again I made my payment on time for the amount I was told. I should not be responsible for their billing errors. As I researched Navient online it appears this is a common practice.\n\nI contacted Navient ( since they took over from Sallie Mae ) to try to get this issue corrected. They did not credit the payment as requested and I have included their summary as the last document. The bottom line is that I paid the amount that was requested by their agent, I paid it 2 weeks early, and when they billed me an additional amount ( above the statement amount ) the following month I paid that in full as well. Clearly I met my obligation for that to be a qualifying payment.I should not be punished for their employee 's mistake. As I am nearing the end of my PSLF program I am trying to ensure I have credit for all of my payments.

At the time, my XXXX loans had a fairly low interest rate and payment of around $ 300/month. Perfectly manageable. My consolidation was $ XXXX and interest was set at nearly 8 %.

In XX/XX/XXXX, the due date on my income-driven repayment plan lapsed because I had not received an email alerting me of the yearly requirement for renewal. Upon receiving an email on XX/XX/XXXX that there was an action required on my account, I logged in to find that, because I had not submitted the income-driven plan renewal, ( 1 ) the entire outstanding interest on my loans had capitalized ( + {$19000.00} ) increasing my principal balance by ~10 % and ( 2 ) my monthly loan payment had quadrupled ( to ~ {$2100.00} ). \n\nI also found that I had been sent -- electronically -- one single notification on XX/XX/XXXX to renew my income-driven plan.

more than I had been told it would be, I called Sallie Mae, and was told the extra amount was due to the fact that I didn't pay any of the interest while I was enrolled in school, I said I can not afford that payment, I was told, that is the amount I needed to pay, so I paid what I could, and as the months went on, I kept getting larger and larger \" minimum amount due '' I finally realized that absolutely nothing was coming off the principal, I called them and asked, and it was explained to me that every month I paid less than the minimum due there was penalty put on, and all the interest and penalties would be taken off my payment first and if anything was left than it would come off principal, I was just going in the hole more and more, so, being young and XXXX, I stopped paying completely and I received periodic phone calls for a couple of months, than total silence, so I just forgot, and let it go, well approximately XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail, not certified or anything saying I had a telephone court date, so I called in on the date, and the judge said, ok, what is the case here, I started to explain what I explained above, he interrupted and said, ok, you two sides work out a payment deal, and we will reconvene, and he got off the line, I said, I guess we need to work something out, the person for Sallie Mae said, we will accept {$850.00}

didn't even give me a chance to bring up my defense that they are private student loans, and private student loans are subject to statute of limitations so they shouldn't have even been in court. this

XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and my servicing company was XXXX. XXXX  was very easy to work with always had the most accurate information. Information regarding the number of qualifying payments was available and up to date on their website. In XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were taken over and transferred by XXXX XXXX without my request, approval or knowledge. I found out this occurred the next time I contacted XXXX. Since I am nearing retirement age, I am always checking to see what the status is of my \" qualifying months ''. Every year I submit a new Employment Verification form as advised by the Department of Education. I contacted XXXX XXXX to request this information and they have NEVER been able to tell me what the number of qualifying months is. The employees who are supposed to provide customer service are anything but. They have an attitude and skirt around every question or request for information I present to them. The ONLY place you can find the qualifying number of payments is on the statement. However, the number of qualifying months KEEPS CHANGING going up and down, mostly going down and my student loan balance keeps going up. They aslo tell me they can not verify any of the payments made to XXXX  yet my account was transferred to XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted them because the XX/XX/XXXX Statement shows only 12 qualifying payments, however, the XX/XX/XXXX statement shows 32 qualifying payments. I thought perhaps there was an error in adding the newly approved payments from the recently submitted Employment Certification Form to the already identified 32 qualifying payments. I was told that since I requested an audit on my account ALL the payments had to be re-verified. This process has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX and they could not tell me how long it would take. I asked to speak to a manager and was basically told that's they way they do things, would not provide me any policy stating the process, did not offer to expedite the process and said this could cause my qualifying payments to do down. Now how hard is it to qualify the payments each year and then add the new qualifying payments each year they receive an Employment Certification form. It is very disenchanting when the qualifying payments becomes a moving target. I am unable to plan for my retirement not knowing how many more years I have to work so my loan will be forgiven.

I have spoken two different XXXX XXXX supervisors who have admitted that this mistake was made by them, but nothing has been done to correct this mistake.

I can enumerate all of the issues below : Initially, I have always been a public servant when repaying my student loans, and have always attempted to be qualified for the public service loan forgiveness program.\n\n1. I was given completely incorrect information regarding payment plans, payment amounts, and was not provided the right information regarding the lowest payment possible. For the first several years ( XXXX ) I was not making the lowest payment possible. I found out many years later that I could have qualified for payments under {$100.00} a month, but was paying 2 or 3 times that amount at any point.\n\n2. I took out a mortgage on my home to pay down my balances. I made it VERY clear that I wanted the payment to go towards the principal balance. Yet, Navient ( around XX/XX/XXXX ) repeatedly applied the balance to future payments. For nearly 3 months I repeatedly called Navient to have them apply the balance to the principal. I am still unsure if they charged me interest on the larger principal balance during that time. \n\n3. I was told in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not have to certify my student loans for PSLF until I had made 120 payments, and that Navient was keeping track of those payments. However, I recently found that many of my coworkers certify their employment on an annual basis, and that their loans are held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted, once a month, for the last 18 months ( XX/XX/XXXX to present day ) to get information from Navient regarding any PSLF certification paperwork. They REPEATEDLY told me they would send me information via email or mail, and I would never receive this paperwork. Finally, I went online and did a search on my own. I have attempted to get documentation regarding my numerous phone calls and was told they do not email others. Further, I was told that they do not keep any log of calls made by borrowers.</td><td>List(numer, loan, compani, select, issu, previous, page, enumer, initi, alway, public, servant, repay, student, alway, qualifi, public, servic, loan, forgiv, program, given, complet, incorrect, inform, regard, payment, payment, provid, right, inform, regard, payment, possibl, first, sever, make, payment, possibl, found, mani, later, could, qualifi, month, pay, time, amount, point, took, mortgag, home, made, clear, payment, toward, princip, balanc, around, repeat, appli, balanc, futur, near, repeat, appli, balanc, princip, still, unsur, interest, princip, balanc, time, told, certifi, student, made, keep, track, howev, recent, found, mani, certifi, employ, annual, basi, month, last, present, inform, regard, certif, repeat, told, would, send, inform, mail, would, never, receiv, final, went, search, document, regard, numer, phone, told, told, keep, made)</td></tr><tr><td>On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to Navient Collections department. I was told that my assigned agent XXXX was unavailable so I spoke to a XXXX instead. This representative told me that I had been rejected from the income based repayment program ( after setting up about 3 years of a monthly auto-debit of {$720.00} ). He said that I needed to have my co-signer ( mother ) call in to submit her financial statement before being able to resubmit me for approval. I am nearing default on my loans because they never approved my {$720.00} payments and tell me I need to be making principal payments of around {$1200.00}. The fact that I was nearing default on only some of my loans but not others leads me to believe that they are misapplying my payments. I believe that if my payment had been applied proportionally to each loan, I wouldnt have reached this stage in my delinquency so soon. By applying my payments in this way, Navient is ensuring that I default on my loans more quickly. \n\nOn Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, my mother called in and provided her financial statement. She spoke to another representative named XXXX, who said that XXXX was not available and XXXX would be out for a long time. His version of what happened differed from XXXX. He told my mom that her financial information wouldnt necessarily help me and that I had to make another financial statement ( the last financial statement I made was in XXXX ). They convinced her to make a payment of about {$290.00} to pull some of my loans out of risk of default. \n\nOn Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called the number that XXXX had given me. I was surprised to be told that my loan was no longer handled by that department and now the person I was speaking to ( cant recall the name ) was my new assigned agent. I was skeptical and pushed to try to speak to the agent that was familiar with my situation, the agent put a supervisor on the line who said they could not transfer me to XXXX and that I would need to work with them. They were not familiar with my situation at all. They convinced me to make a payment of {$29.00} and to submit more financial information. \n\nThat same night on Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called back to see if I could get some more information about my loans. I couldnt find any statements online from before XXXX of XXXX. The Navient website offered no clear way to see a record of my individual loan payments, how theyve been applied, and how theyve affected my principal balance. When I asked the agent from Navient if they could provide an electronic copy of this, they told me it was impossible. Moreover, that kind of request had to be submitted to the back office and could take a week or more to send. She transferred me to general customer service to see if they could help me get the information from the website, however that agent was also not helpful. Not only did she confirm that the Navient website has no way to access loan records and documents, she also could not give me accurate answers to questions I was asking in regard to my loan history. She told me my first payment was made in XXXX, but I graduated in XXXX and started making payments in XXXX. \n\nNavient is purposefully making it difficult for me to get accurate information about my options and my loan history. While it is difficult to come up with an accurate figure based on the limited information on the website, I estimate that I have made well over {$50000.00} in payments to Navient/Sallie Mae since my college graduation. Between my mostly private and federal loans, the total amount I owe has gone up by more than what Ive paid into it. In other words, I am just throwing money away while my debt continues to grow.</td><td>List(spoke, depart, told, assign, agent, unavail, spoke, instead, repres, told, incom, base, repay, program, set, month, said, cosign, mother, call, submit, financi, statement, abl, resubmit, approv, default, never, tell, need, make, princip, around, fact, default, believ, believ, payment, appli, proport, loan, wouldnt, stage, delinqu, soon, default, quick, mother, provid, financi, statement, spoke, anoth, repres, said, avail, would, long, time, version, told, financi, inform, wouldnt, necessarili, help, make, anoth, financi, statement, last, financi, statement, made, convinc, make, payment, pull, risk, default, number, given, told, loan, longer, handl, depart, person, speak, cant, recal, name, assign, agent, skeptic, speak, agent, familiar, situat, agent, supervisor, line, said, could, transfer, would, need, work, familiar, situat, convinc, make, payment, submit, financi, inform, night, back, could, inform, find, clear, record, individu, loan, appli, affect, princip, balanc, agent, could, provid, electron, copi, told, imposs, moreov, kind, request, back, offic, could, take, week, send, transfer, general, custom, servic, could, help, inform, howev, agent, also, help, confirm, access, loan, also, could, give, accur, regard, loan, histori, told, first, payment, made, graduat, make, purpos, make, difficult, accur, inform, loan, histori, difficult, come, accur, figur, base, limit, inform, estim, made, well, sinc, colleg, graduat, most, privat, feder, total, amount, gone, throw, money, away, debt, grow)</td></tr><tr><td>After having paid off loan 1-02 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized on XXXX for {$1600.00}, I called customer service to have my autopay loan 1-07 DL Consolidated - Unsubsidized payment adjusted to match what it had been in prior months. Every month that I finish paying off one of my loans, Navient will change the amount of the autopay being paid to the higher interest loans and always in their favor. For example, instead of adjusting the payment schedule on the lower interest loans, they always short the highest interest loans. \n\nWhen they finally adjusted the payment allocation correctly to loan 1-07 DL Consolidated - Unsubsidized in XXXX, they opened one of my paid off loans ( 1-02 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized ) and added a principal balance of {$110.00}.

When I received my notice, it stated that only 15 of my 70-80 or so payments have qualified, basically disqualifying me from the program as I will have paid my loans off before I reach 120 payments.

It targeted low-income students, promising a quality education and career opportunities, and charged them high tuitions for sub-standard programs. After years of declining profits and trouble maintaining accreditation, XXXX began to sell its schools. \nIn XXXX, XXXX sold most of its schools for {$60.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, a subsidiary of a XXXX-based religious organization, the XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is in the process of converting the schoolsfrom for-profit to non-profit status. XXXX XXXXXXXX application to the Department of Education to approve the non-profit conversion is pending. If the conversion is approved, XXXX XXXXoperated schools will be subject to even less federal oversight than they are currently. You can read more about the sale and proposed conversion in an earlier post here. \nOn Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and 58 related companies filed for bankruptcy.The bankruptcy filings include some of the campuses that XXXX sold and also some that it didnt sell. \nThe bankruptcy filings say that XXXX does not expect to have any funds to distribute to unsecured creditors. In other words, it wont have any money left at the end of the bankruptcy. In fact, XXXX says that it has between {$0.00} and {$50000.00} in assets, but owes between {$500.00} million and {$1.00} billion. Its list of people and companies it owes money to is 1,500 pages long, and includes political campaigns, copy companies, and financial institutions. It will file more financial information in the coming weeks. \nOne of XXXXs lawyers for the bankruptcy is XXXX XXXX, from the firm XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are also representing the estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), in its bankruptcy, which was filed in XX/XX/XXXX. You can read more about the XXXX bankruptcy and the XXXX representation of former XXXX students here. \nAt the same time that XXXX filed for bankruptcy, XXXX XXXX announcedin an internal memo that it will close 30 of the campuses that it bought from XXXX just last year, including several XXXX XXXX campuses.XXXX XXXX has since confirmed these plans, and blames declining enrollment and an increased demand for online education for the closures. \nAlthough were not yet sure what, if any, connection exists between XXXX filings and the XXXX XXXX closures, it is clear that both corporations are acting to protect their own interest while further harming their former and current students. \nXXXX XXXX has provided limited information about the closures, but it has shared its plan for affected students. We have summarized its plan below. At the bottom of this post is a list of campuses that XXXX XXXX has said it will close. \n\nINFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES HOW THE CLOSURES WILL AFFECT STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED Through leaked XXXX XXXX memos and accountsandformsshared by current students, the XXXX on Predatory Student Lending has learned that XXXX XXXX is giving students at closing campuses 5 options. Here is what weve learned, some information about loan cancellation, and important things to keep in mind until we learn more. A full list of affected schools is at the end of this post. \nOptions For Students at Closing Schools XXXX XXXX announced that students may choose from the following 5 options for how to continue their education : -Complete your degree at your current campus by the end of XXXX, when the campus will close -Complete your degree via the XXXX XXXX XXXX -Complete your degree at another XXXX XXXX campus -Complete your degree at another XXXX XXXX school, either XXXX University or XXXX University -Transfer to another , unspecified university outside the XXXX XXXX network of schools XXXX XXXX is trying to convince students to accept these options by offering a 50 % tuition reduction to students who remain at a XXXX XXXX   school and a {$5000.00} tuition grant to students who transfer to one the unspecified other schools. \nWe have not been able to determine what will happen to students who choose not to accept these options, but it is likely that they will be automatically withdrawn from their program. \nStudents should notlet XXXX XXXX trick them into accepting these offers before they have all the information they need to make an informed decision! Only accept an offer once you have all the information and if its the best option for you. \nAs part of these offers, XXXX XXXX will make students sign acknowledge forms and waivers that will relieve it of any responsibility it owes to students and may prevent students from receiving relief from their federal loans in the future. \nStudents should notsign anything until they have read it carefully, had all of their questions answered, and decided that what the best decision is for them! \nXXXX XXXX is Trying to Deprive Students of Their Right to Loan Cancellation The federal government has a program called the Closed School Discharge program that will cancel federal student loans when students schools close. It is only available to students who are enrolled when the school closes or who had withdrawn within 120 days of the school closure. Students who accept an offer to continue their education somewhere else when their school closes do not qualify for Closed School Discharges. \nIn a public disclosure, the XXXX XXXX XXXX, an accrediting agency that oversees two XXXX XXXX campuses in Illinois and Colorado, recognizes that these schools are at risk of closing and urges students to be aware of Closed School Discharges. XXXX XXXX does not want its students to get Closed School Discharges! Thats because they will have to pay back the government for each loan that is cancelled from its schools. \nXXXX XXXX timed its closings so that anyone who withdraws will do so more than 120 from the closing, and is using tuition discounts to convince students to stay enrolled. These are both ways to prevent students from qualifying for a Closed School Discharge. This is not right! \nImportant Information for Students Theres still a lot that we dont know about XXXX XXXX plan to close its school, and how that will affect students rights. While we wait to learn more, it is important for affected students to ask questions, share information, and protect themselves. Here are a few specific things you can do : -Ask your school for to be placed on a formal leave of absence. XXXX XXXX   schools may not agree to give leaves of absence, but if they do it may help buy some time and maintain students eligibility for Closed School Discharges -Do not sign anything without reading it completely, getting all of your questions answered, and understanding how it affects your right to a Closed School Discharge or to enforce your rights against your school. XXXX XXXX might try to have you waive your rights. Do not do that without understanding the full impact of that decision, which will vary student by student. \n-Share your experience and information!! There are 1000s of students across the country that are affected by this. Join XXXX groups. If you receive information from your school, share it! \n-Visit the Debt Collective website and learn how borrowers across the country are fighting back against bad schools and unfair and illegal debt. \n-Continue to visit this blog for updates. \n-Contact your U.S. representative or senator and let them know whats happening! Demand that they pressure the Department of Education to declare that all students affected by these closures are eligible for Closed School Discharges unless they WANT to accept XXXX XXXX offers. \nXXXXs Bankruptcy May Limit Students Ability To Recover From Their Schools For former students of XXXX-operated schools, XXXXs bankruptcy may limit their ability to seek recovery directly from their school, even in arbitration. Former students may wish to file claims in one or more of the bankruptcy cases ; more information will follow in the coming days. \nPlease visit the Federal Student Aid website, the Debt Collective, or contactthe XXXX   on Predatory Student Lending ( thats us! ) to learn more. \nThe XXXX on Predatory Student Lending is fighting for and with students who have been cheated by the predatory federally-funded colleges. We are monitoring the XXXX   filings and XXXX XXXX closures and will provide updates for affected students as soon as possible. \n\nList of Affected Schools XXXX XXXX CAMPUSES SOLD TO THE XXXX XXXX The XXXX XXXX will cease enrollment at the following 18 XXXX XXXX campuses : Arizona : XXXX California : XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX Colorado : XXXX Florida : XXXX XXXX Illinois : XXXX, XXXX Indiana : XXXX Michigan : XXXX North Carolina : XXXX, XXXX Oregon : XXXX Pennsylvania : XXXX South Carolina : XXXX Tennessee : XXXX Virginia : XXXX The XXXX XXXX will continue to operate the following 12 XXXX XXXX campuses : California : XXXX, XXXX XXXX Florida : XXXX Georgia : XXXX Nevada : XXXX XXXX Pennsylvania : XXXX Texas : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX Virginia : Virginia XXXX Washington : XXXX All other XXXX XXXX were not sold to XXXX XXXX and have closed. \n\nXXXX THE XXXX XXXX WILL CEASE ENROLLMENT AT THE FOLLOWING 10 XXXX CAMPUSES : California : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Colorado : XXXX Florida : XXXX Illinois : XXXX Tennessee : XXXX Texas : XXXX Utah : XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington : XXXX XXXX THE XXXX XXXX   WILL CEASE ENROLLMENT AT THE FOLLOWING 3 SOUTH CAMPUSES : Michigan : XXXX North Carolina : XXXX XXXX Ohio : XXXX Read more XXXX on Predatory Student Lending Statement on Proposed Sale of XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, News, XXXX on Predatory Student Lending - XX/XX/XXXX Last Friday, for-profit college giant XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) announced the sale of many of its campuses to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The acquisition would convert three of the corporations chainsthe XXXX XXXX, XXXX University, and XXXX Universityinto nonprofits. XXXX will retain ownership of the XXXX XXXX chain, which is shutting down most of its campuses, and the 19 XXXX XXXX campuses the corporation is in the process of shutting down. \nXXXXs conversion to nonprofit status raises critical questions, including how the corporation intends to ensure positive student outcomes once it is no longer subject to gainful employment regulations. XXXX has more than 130 programs that the federal government has found to burden graduates with unmanageable student loan debtprograms that will be subject to even less federal oversight once they have been sold to a nonprofit. XXXXs compliance with federal requirements attached to the receipt of federal Title IV funds will be even more critical once the corporation is no longer subject to the 90-10 rule, which prevents for-profit colleges from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenues from such funds.\n\nLike the last-ditch sale of many XXXX campuses as that company failed, this sale leaves failing schools with XXXX, while selling off assets that may still have value to a new entity that may disclaim liability for the acts of its predecessors. This type of transaction leaves former students struggling with unmanageable debt even more completely without recourse. \nLess than a year ago, XXXX tried to sell the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, an XXXX XXXX campus in XXXX, Massachusetts, to a university based in XXXX. The deal was scuttled after the corporations failed to obtain state approval. As XXXXs equity holders continue to try to divest themselves of these assets, regulators should demand assurances that whoever owns the schools will operate them in the interests of students. \nXXXX The XXXX  on Predatory Student Lending represents a group of former students who attended the XXXX-owned XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, these former students demanded that the companies remedy the harms they had caused to students and their families. The XXXX  and Public Justice are currently challenging the federal governments refusal to provide documents shedding light on XXXXs recruiting practices. \nRead more XXXX on Predatory Student Lending Sues Federal Government For Withholding For-Profit College Corporations Recruitment Records XXXX, News, XXXX on Predatory Student Lending - XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, theXXXX on Predatory Student Lendingof the Legal Services Center of XXXX XXXX XXXX filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit, challenging the governments refusal to provide documents shedding light on for-profit college giant XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) s recruitment practices. \nMonths ago, the XXXX filed a FOIA request with the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), seeking access to these documents. DOJ claimed that it couldnt release the documents ( in part ) because it said there was a court order preventing it from doing so. The XXXX disagreed. So, together with XXXX XXXX, we asked the court that issued the order to clarify that the order does not, in fact, prevent DOJ from releasing the documents. \nSoon after we asked the court for clarification, however, DOJ changed its tune entirely. It now claims that the public has no right to access these documents, even though they were produced to the government by a corporation the government alleged defrauded it of billions of dollars, and would enable the public to evaluate the governments decision to settle its claims for less than one percent of what it had originally said they were worth. \nThe lawsuit challenges the governments assertion that the public has no right to these important documents. \nTwo Federal Lawsuits, Still No Documents Federal regulations allow student loan borrowers to seek cancellation of their federal student loans by showing that their school violated state law. Former students of the XXXX XXXX and other XXXX-owned chains thus want the documents to help prove that they were defrauded, and are entitled to relief on their student loans. Because these documents have been kept secretand because XXXX usesforced arbitration clausestodrive students out of the public court systemborrowers seeking debt relief often have little but their own personal experiences to support their claims of misconduct. \nThe Attorney General of Minnesotaone of the states that participated in the caseexpressed support for the XXXX efforts, stating that the information requested by the XXXX could aid students in their efforts to obtain loan forgiveness from the United States Department of Education, which would unburden them from thousands of dollars of debt. \nThe XXXX  has made a significant effort to obtain these documentsfiling a freedom of information request, litigating the governments denial of that request, and moving to intervene to challenge the government and XXXXs efforts to keep the documents secretbecause the documents are critical to the XXXX advocacy on behalf of low-income student loan borrowers. The documents will help the XXXX seek relief for former students of XXXX-owned schools ; inform the public about the practices of for-profit education companies and the governments oversight of those companies ; and advocate for policies that will protect low-income student loan borrowers. \nBackground : Government Lawsuit Against XXXX XXXX, a corporation that has been closely associated with XXXX XXXX for years, runs four large chains of for-profit schools, including the beleaguered XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, the federal government, along with several states, sued XXXX, alleging that it violated state and federal law and then lied about it to get government funding. The government claimed that, to maximize enrollments, XXXX illegally paid its admissions employees based on the number of students they could enroll ; created a boiler room style sales culture, the relentless and exclusive focus of which was the number of new students each recruiter could sign up ; taught its recruiters to exploit prospective students vulnerabilities ; and rewarded those who recruited the most students with bonuses, extra time off, vacations, and gifts. \nThe lawsuit eventually settled in XXXX for {$95.00} million, less than one percent of the more than {$11.00} billion in taxpayer-funded federal student grants and loans that the government alleged XXXX received between XX/XX/XXXX and the suits filing. The settlement did not relieve students of any of the federal student loan debt they took on to attend XXXX-owned schools. \nDocuments Related to This Case Freedom of Information Act Requests, Appeal, and Complaint : XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Requests to DOJ and Intervening States ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Appeal ( PDF ) Project on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Complaint ( PDF ) Intervention ( XXXX XXXX ) : XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion for Clarification of Protective Order ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Reply in Support of Motion to Intervene ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Reply in Support of Motion for Clarification of Protective Order ( PDF ) About the XXXX on Predatory Student Lending The XXXX on Predatory Student Lending fights for low-income borrowers, representing students and families who have experienced unfair, deceptive, and illegal conduct at the hands of for-profit colleges.

XXXX, the government alleged, created a boiler room style sales culture, the relentless and exclusive focus of which was the number of new students each recruiter could sign up. To maximize enrollments, the lawsuit alleged, XXXX taught its recruiters to exploit prospective students vulnerabilities, and rewarded those who recruited the most students with bonuses, extra time off, vacations, and gifts. \nThe lawsuit eventually settled in XXXX for {$95.00} million, much less thanthe {$1.00} billion the company received in taxpayer-funded federal student grants and loans in the XXXXyear alone. But as part of discovery in the suit, XXXX produced a lot of documents that we believe will shed light on their recruitment practices. The documents from this lawsuit are likely to strengthen claims for relief of hundreds, if not thousands, of former XXXXC students, saidXXXX XXXX, one of the attorneys representing the debtors. \nFormer students of the XXXX XXXX and other XXXX-owned chains want these documents to help prove that they were defrauded, and are entitled to relief on their student loans. Because these documents have so far been kept secretand because XXXX usesforced arbitration clausestodrive students out of the public court systemborrowers seeking debt relief often have little but their own personal experiences to corroborate their claims of misconduct. \nWhile taxpayers spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding what the Department of Justice has called XXXX recruitment mill, the borrowers who attended these schools have yet to obtain federal debt relief, said Public Justice attorney XXXX XXXX. \nBefore filing this lawsuit, the XXXX  tried to get these documents showing XXXXs predatory recruitment practices through federal and state freedom of information requests, but its request was denied in part because of a protective order in the case. The XXXX  asked a federal judge to rule that the protective order does not shield the documents. \nDocuments Related to This Case XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings FOIA Requests to DOJ and Intervening States ( PDF ) XXXX  on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene ( PDF ) XXXX on Predatory Student Lendings Brief in Support of Motion for Clarification of Protective Order ( PDF ) About the XXXX  on Predatory Student Lending The XXXX  on Predatory Student Lending fights for low-income borrowers, representing students and families who have experienced unfair, deceptive, and illegal conduct at the hands of for-profit colleges.

I have had some temporary forbearances due to a parent 's XXXX XXXX  and a lengthy contested divorce, but my remaining balance has remained the same despite many steady years of repayment. The terms of the loan repayment appear to be a deceptive interest only scheme, which is something I would never have agreed to if the terms had been properly explained. If my student loan amount of {$21000.00} were a car loan, it would have been paid off already in less than 10 years. The terms of my loan are suspicious and my student loan has become an chronic, persistent, never ending financial burden. My only option is to now obtain a home equity loan to pay off my student loan as the terms of a home equity loan will be far more cost effective and safer than the unconventional and misleading Navient student loan terms. I should have been better advised 10 years ago as I could have saved thousands of wasted personal income by securing a home equity loan then as a more sound method of repayment. As a single parent, Navient has profiteered and deprived my XXXX children of expenses that could have used for their educational fund. My conclusion is that student loan repayment services like, Navient, are predatory lending agencies designed to generate immense revenues at the expense of the student versus assisting with the cost of education.

We have not been contacted however regarding our qualification. \nOur loans : XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. \nXXXX filled a lawsuit against us on XXXX. 1. ) This date was past the state of Tennessee 's statute of limitations. Due to incredible financial pressures and job loss, my husband and I filed for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. Once the XXXX received the formal notice of the bankruptcy, they obtained a voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit. 2 ) In XXXX I was contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX law firm and told XXXX had been awarded a new judgement and were seeking a payment plan or else they would follow through with wage garnishments already approved by the court. I questioned the law firm concerning the new judgement and wage garnishment, as I had had no further contact from the XXXX  since the voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit.

I called about 2 weeks ago and spoke to a customer service manager that an option for me to lower my payment would be to refinance the loan with SOFI, which would lower my interest and therefore lower my monthly payment amount. \n\nI applied for a refinance while I was waiting for a forbearance application to be reviewed and approved. The amount I was quoted with the refinance application was under {$700.00}, which would allow me to make my full monthly payment and not have to apply for forbearances. \n\nHowever, the application was 'stalled ' because when I connected my XXXX account to my Sofi application, an communication error between XXXX and SOfi occurred. on XX/XX/XXXX, I called SOFI and was told to call XXXX and ask that they updated their files. I debated why I should have to call XXXX when the issue was between Sofi and XXXX - I had provided all documentation and information requested of me. In the interest of time, I tried to submit the student loan documentation they were requesting manually, but it would not upload to my application. I therefore emailed SOFI directly with the information/documentation. A few hours later, I received a denial of my application - even though I was 1. told to apply, 2. pre-approved, and 3. have a very high credit score, good income, and no delinquencies on my credit report. \n\nIn follow up emails, SOFI explained the reason was because I had not provided documentation of my income and that I had I had a bad internal credit score with SOFI due to my use of forbearances. I had provided documentation of my income, and I'm receiving a 3 % raise in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, these forbearances were approved by SOFI and I was never told that use of necessary forbearances would impact my ability to refinance in the future. Nor was this mentioned as a potential barrier when I was told to apply for a refinance of my loans. \n\nI'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm trying to do what is responsible and necessary in order to not go into default with my private student loans. I asked for guidance on what to do to lower my payment and was told to refinance by SOFI, was preapproved, and provided all necessary documentation/information for my application. By denying my application, SOFI has essentially removed the only mechanism I have to lower my monthly payment amount. This is not being customer friendly or helpful to someone with a high student loan debt burden. SOFI is forcing me to go into default with my student loans. \n\nI DO NOT HAVE A CO-SIGNER nor a potential Co-signer, so do not offer this as a suggestion. I should not need a co-signer with a nearly 800 credit score making over {$80000.00} ; I was able to take out a mortgage for double the amount of what I owe in private student loans on my own, without a co-signer, when I had less income and a lower credit score.</td><td>List(struggl, privat, student, loan, bill, file, seri, order, account, loan, spoke, custom, servic, manag, option, lower, payment, would, refin, loan, would, lower, interest, therefor, lower, month, payment, amount, appli, refin, wait, forbear, applic, amount, refin, applic, would, allow, make, full, month, payment, appli, howev, applic, connect, account, applic, communic, error, told, call, call, issu, provid, document, inform, interest, time, tri, submit, student, loan, document, manual, would, applic, therefor, direct, later, receiv, denial, applic, even, though, told, appli, high, credit, score, good, incom, credit, report, follow, reason, provid, document, incom, intern, credit, score, provid, document, incom, rais, also, never, told, necessari, would, impact, abil, refin, futur, potenti, barrier, told, appli, refin, stuck, rock, hard, place, tri, respons, necessari, order, default, privat, student, guidanc, lower, payment, told, refin, provid, necessari, applic, applic, essenti, remov, mechan, lower, month, payment, amount, custom, friend, help, someon, high, student, loan, debt, burden, forc, default, student, cosign, potenti, cosign, offer, suggest, need, cosign, near, credit, score, make, abl, take, mortgag, doubl, amount, privat, student, without, cosign, less, incom, lower, credit, score)</td></tr><tr><td>My student loan servicer was perviously XXXX and now it is Navient both whom I had major trouble with.

This was despite the fact that I submitted my XXXX 's and my IRS tax transcript. This delayed my re-certification past the deadline despite me submitting everything on time. During the multiple phone calls to resolve this issue they mentioned that while I clicked to recertify back into my same plan I also clicked a box on my forms erroneously to try to put me into a lower repayment program. It was a short discussion notifying me that I could be eligible to be put in a similar program that would not effect my PSLF eligibility and I would simply pay less each month. I told them I was fine with this as long as it did not effect anything overall. As I have had other friends do this I did not think much of it. \n\nUnfortunately my loans initially got put into standard repayment so I was debited {$560.00} for an unclear reason, then {$8000.00} from my account. I needed to call my bank to have this payment stopped. I also have an upcoming payment due for > {$3600.00}. My loans were supposed to be put in forbearance during the switch over as it takes XXXX a few months to determine my new program and monthly payment. Now I have XXXX payment overdue and likely another upcoming as I will not be paying the {$3600.00}. \n\nNow finally they have given me the info about my new repayment program and I will be paying > {$1900.00} a month.

To add to this confusion I was initially quoted approx {$1200.00} for the new program. \n\nOn top of this I just realized that they added over {$43000.00} to my loan balance due to interest capitalization from the switch over of my loans. This was never explained to me and I would never had agreed to a switch if I new this would happen. \n\nWhen I spoke to a supervisor from XXXX the only option he gave me was to continue with the new repayment program and they will try to correct the {$8000.00} and {$3600.00} payment owed.

This month, I supposedly owe XXXX. When I called today ( XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX E. ) to ask why, the customer service representative had no idea what to tell me.

I have had an account with this servicer since XX/XX/XXXX when two Direct Consolidated ( one Subsidized & one Unsubsidized ) Loans were dispersed. \n\nI have been making on time monthly payments to my lender in hopes of qualifying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). This program allows those working for non-profit organizations to receive complete loan forgiveness after 120 monthly payments under a qualifying income-based repayment plan. As a way to track progress, I am obligated to submit employment certification forms to FedLoan which confirms my eligibility and shows my time remaining in the program. Previously, I had received a letter directly from FedLoan Servicing indicating thetotal PSLF qualifying payments I made from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, in which it concluded was 32 qualifying payments. Ihave attached the supporting documentation. I have continued to make on time payments and submit employment verification since XX/XX/XXXX, but sometime between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX FedLoan re-dispersedmy two Direct ( Subsidized and Unsubsidized ) Consolidated loans and created 3 new Direct Consolidated loan amounts ( now 1 Subsidized and 2 Unsubsidized ). In doing so they essentially reset my PSLF qualifying payment counts back to zero starting the Fall of XXXX. I am left with no clear indication that they will honor the previous qualifying loan payments. \n\nI have contacted FedLoan numerous times to rectify the counts and have received inconsistent explanations each time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested for a formal review to be made of my account and that the total number of qualifying payments be recalculated and updated. At that time I was told that my original 2 consolidated Direct loans were split into 3 new loans due to the amount of interest my loans were generating, but that all of my prior payments would still be credited despite the changes. I then this week called to follow up and was told that there is a pending review because FedLoan is waiting for documentation from my \" prior loan servicer ''. They claim that FedLoanhas only been my loan servicersince XX/XX/XXXX, which is incorrect since they have been the servicer since XXXX. This to me indicates that they have lost all prior documentation of my on time, qualifying loan payments to FedLoan and I am concerned that all of my prior qualifying payments will not be counted.The total PSLF qualifying payment count should be approximately 51 payments from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ( the date of my most recent employment verification.</td><td>List(write, complaint, inadequ, student, account, sinc, direct, consolid, unsubsid, dispers, make, time, month, lender, public, servic, loan, forgiv, program, work, nonprofit, receiv, complet, loan, forgiv, month, repay, plan, track, progress, submit, employ, certif, elig, time, program, previous, receiv, letter, direct, made, attach, support, document, continu, make, time, submit, employ, verif, sinc, sometim, direct, unsubsid, consolid, direct, consolid, loan, unsubsid, essenti, reset, payment, back, zero, start, fall, left, clear, indic, honor, previous, loan, numer, time, rectifi, receiv, inconsist, time, formal, review, made, account, total, number, time, told, origin, consolid, direct, split, amount, interest, generat, prior, would, still, despit, week, follow, told, pend, review, wait, document, prior, loan, claim, loan, incorrect, sinc, sinc, lost, prior, document, time, loan, concern, prior, total, payment, count, approxim, date, recent, employ, verif)</td></tr><tr><td>This is regarding Navient.

After my 6 month grace period of starting repayment ended in XX/XX/XXXX I took a 3 month forbearance.

I would not have taken that forbearance had that been disclosed in the first place. \n\nAlmost every single payment I have had was on time- with the exception of 1 payment when I was in XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, however that payment does not even show as late on my credit history as it did not exceed 30 days. \n\nWhen I called to correct my late payment in XX/XX/XXXX, they informed me that I would have been eligible to do the \" easy '' co-signer release since I was showing 5 years of on time payments prior to the missed payment in XXXX and that all I needed to meet that requirement was 24 months of on-time payments. I was very very frustrated as I had been told before that I negated my ability to ever release my co-signer due to my small 3 month forbearance prior to working as a nurse. \n\nI have applied for co-signer release in the past and again in XX/XX/XXXX. I found out today on XX/XX/XXXX that I was rejected again. Despite showing proof of almost XXXX in income and an impeccable credit history. There is not a single negative mark on my credit, nor is there a single reported late payment on anything.

I also started a second job in XX/XX/XXXX and am projected to make well over $ XXXX on my own without including any of my husbands income this year. \n\nI feel like a number on a piece of paper- my credit score is being dragged down by the debt to income ratio, but did they even bother to look at my credit history- that I have well established credit over the last 12 years with not a single late payment?!? I will never ever do business with Wells Fargo again. I have been a loyal customer and dedicated to making my payments on time and even staying months ahead by paying well in advance and I am infuriated that they will not grant me one ounce of faith or grace in this situation- as my co-signer had granted me his faith and his grace in the past. \n\nNow my co-signer is fed up. He owns several businesses and properties and is constantly having to explain this random student loan linked to his credit.

The only place this form is found is before logging into your account at the bottom of their web page in small writing. AKA where no one will look. After that you must submit this form, they give plenty of options to submit for deferment and avoiding the loans, but force the form to get out of deferment to fall into the other category. This category, of course, takes longer because it does not give a defined path to a representative. While on the phone I also asked about the ability to target higher interest loans with extra payments because my employer also helps with my loans. Apparently you can only target higher loans with single payments, not auto payments. Now not only did they mess up my loan statues but have also messed up my employer 's contributions.

I have also been making overpayments monthly for some time now and Navient appears to be applying overpayments also to Interest rather than to Principle. Its site shows my original balance with them was, as noted above, {$71000.00}, but that my current balance is today at {$70000.00}, after all these years and all payments made!!! My balance seems to be going up rather than down, and the interest charged in forebearance/deferments must have impacted this but I can't tell.

I asked XXXX to speak with a supervisor as I could not understand why I was paying for their failure to timely submitted my application. I then spoke with XXXX, employee ID XXXX, who said my only option would be to take a deferment. I explained that was not ideal since if I do not pay off my loans that would not count towards my forgiveness period and would add an extra payment on at the end of the 25 year forgiveness period when I will be hopefully making more money. He said there was nothing that could be done other than the deferment. I then stated that I was typing a complaint to the CFPB as I spoke and he was going on the record that I had to take a deferment even though I had timely submitted my application, but they had not timely processed it. He then said he was going to check on something and put me on hold. When he came back, he said he would escalate the issue and process my application himself today, XX/XX/XXXX, and put in a request for my XXXX statement to be reissued, but that there was no guarantee that it would be processed and my payment adjusted. He said I could take a deferment even after XX/XX/XXXX, but since I have direct debit, that I would need to request the deferment by XX/XX/XXXX to avoid the draft of {$2700.00}. \n\nI have had similar issues like the one described above every single year in renewing my income driven repayment request.

One has an interest rate of 4.250 % and the other an interest rate of 3.150 %. I selected to manually enter my instructions for the payment and requested 100 % be applied to the higher interest loan, which should have eliminated this loan with a small amount left over. Instead, approximately {$770.00} was applied to this loan and the rest to the lower interest loan. \n\nI acknowledge that it appears there is a caveat in the instructions that pending payments may be applied first, but would note that my loan account also states that I am paid ahead by over {$6000.00}, I am not required to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX, and I had just completed a scheduled payment on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, the payment of this loan as directed would ( to my understanding ) changed what my next scheduled payment will be, as one of the loans would have been eliminated. \n\nFurther, I was unable to determine any place on the Great Lakes site that outlined a breakdown of my scheduled payment per loan in the account rather than for the overall account, making payers unable to discern how to adjust any excess payments. For example, if I have a pending payment of {$150.00} on an account containing two loans, if I wanted to pay one loan off that is {$500.00} and do not know the portion of scheduled payments that might be automatically applied to other loan I do not know how much I should add to that {$150.00} to pay off the {$500.00}. Payoff amounts are, to my knowledge, only able to be calculated based on the entire account, not each loan in the account. I feel that all of this combined unfairly prevents payers using an \" avalanche '' method to pay off higher interest loans first, allowing those loans to exist for a longer amount of time and gaining interest.

The sales person had no idea of my skills but found that I wanted to study XXXX and she quickly recruited me to go in for an interview at the campus. When I went to the interview I was told that I had what it took to join and be successful in the field of XXXX XXXX  and that it would be beneficial for me to study there. Before I knew it I was enrolled and the beginning of my student loans had started. The cost for the school was supposed to be XXXX but at graduation it was over XXXX to this day it still remains over $ XXXX. Every quarter there were more and more loans asked for and halfway through the program I knew that there was something wrong and I was just one of many that this school had preyed on. At this point I went to a guidance counselor and she told me that if I don't continue and dropped out that my family would see me as unsuccessful and that everything in this world revolved an accredited XXXX degree. I was unhappy because the XXXX  XXXX program that I signed up for was taken away and now the class of XXXX were being used to work solely on XXXX. A lot of us were not happy with that because they lied to us and switched the curriculum and now our final demo reels had to be in XXXX. Something that I was not into. In the beginning I was told that I would get job placement and will be working with XXXX XXXX. They used a lot of sales tactics to keep me in the school and when I complained about a 3d class that I had to pass and the teacher wouldn't allow me to pass I was given a \" P '' simply because I said I would complain to the board. The teacher was eventually fired for allowing students to pass if they beat him in Halo on the last day of class. His name was XXXX XXXX XXXX. The school was full of untrained teachers. XXXX XXXX was teaching us a class in Shake which she was just learning along with us. I was recruited into a school that didn't care about the students it felt like and only cared about recruitment. It was a for profit school and you can tell that it was based on recruitments because students there the majority didn't have an artistic talent. The school has closed along with many other Art Institutes throughout the country and they have been sued for using predatory sales practices on students that signed up for their programs during the time that I attended. Going to that school was the worst mistake of my life. It has put me in a position where I have been paying for student loans for the past 13 years for a school that has since closed it's doors and is not accredited in anyway. Once I was out I tried to enroll in a different college only to find out that the classes I took there were not considered university or college credits, I would have to take the classes over. The school has been sued and has to forgive student loans due to their malpractice predatory sales tactics which I was a victim of. It's not fair that they did this, preyed on individuals and now closed their doors. I have struggled for years to make payments to those loans and for what, a XXXX Degree that no longer sits on my wall because it isn't worth the paper its printed on. Due to the student loans that I acquired in order to stay in school I have been in financial ruin as I have to pay every month. The loan amount now is higher than it was 13 years ago. It seems that every 6 months I have to file a forbearance or a hardship in order to keep Sallie Mae now Navient at bay. They never explained anything in full detail but always wanted me to sign new loans in order to stay enrolled. I had to resort to have my father help co-sign as well as a neighbor. They did that as favors for my future but there was no future from the teachings I received. They lied and they should be held responsible for their actions. The lawsuit forgives students like me and it's been a long time coming for me to finally take the action against these loans. I have gotten my Federal loans forgiven already due to my complaint. The United States Department of Education Borrower Defense to Loan Repayment at XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXX referred  me to your site in order to get my Private Loans forgiven as well.

I attended that institution from XXXX to XXXX. Back then, I never paid more than {$1600.00} per year {$800.00} per semester. I consolidated all my loans after my graduation and started paying {$300.00} per month for a couple of years. At that time I was making {$28000.00} working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX as an XXXX XXXX. \nDuring this period I married XXXX XXXX XXXX. He decided that I was using too much money for myself by paying my own loan, because I was the only one working and was the breadwinner for XXXX of us. So he was determined to find a way for his debt to be paid even though he wasnt working. \n\nIn XXXX, Navient in complicity with my husband deceitfully misguided me into a joint consolidated loan. My husband was verbally abusive, calling me selfish, unfit mother and used all kind of threats and intimidation to stop me from paying my loan. He contrived a plan to consolidate his debt with mine and a navient customer service representative convinced me that it was in my best interest. This representative claimed that this would be the best deal I would ever have, if I consolidated with my husband. I reiterated that my student loans were consolidated previously. The Navient agent kept on telling me : \" Great! You still can consolidate and it is going to be in your best interest. The agent provided me with unclear and deceitful information such as : 1- I can re-consolidate with my husband even though I have already consolidated. \n2- The joint consolidation will decrease my interest from 6 % to only 2 %. \nMy husbands plan was to make me pay the entire loan myself. I did pay it from XXXX to XXXX until my husband forced me to resign at the XXXX XXXX and move to Florida. There, I continued paying until XXXX. Unfortunately, it is after this move to Florida that I learned my husband had been XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, since she was XXXX. He wanted us to be away from family and friends so he could XXXX XXXX XXXX without the watchful eye of those who loved me and my children. At this point, I was still with my husband and he was working and he did not pay his fair share. Instead, he put pressure on me and tried to force me to sign for forbearance. After I knew about better options, I refused to sign for forbearance. My husband then forged my signature in order to get a forbearance. I informed Navient about it, they told me they can not do anything. \nThe XXXX XXXX that I suffered and knowledge of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX led to my divorce. After this traumatizing event, I was unemployed for 7 years trying to rebuild and recover from such damaging period in my life. I informed Navient about the aforementioned facts and reiterated that I am currently unemployed. Navient never informed me about loan forgiveness and/or income driven repayment. In fact, it kept on steering me toward multiple forbearances. I just learned if you work for a XXXX XXXX for 10 years, your school loan can be forgiven, I was with the XXXX XXXX for 6 years. If Navient did not fail to inform me, I would have fought to stay with the organization  until I retired. \nI know that my student loans were around {$10000.00}. I had paid {$300.00} for 3 years before re-consolidating with my husband in XXXX. Then I continued paying for 3 more years until my abusive ex-husband forced me to resign another job. From my calculations I have paid off 80 % of the debt that I previously had. On top of it, I paid Navient for 3 more years after the deceitful re-consolidation. I do not understand how I ended up owing {$78000.00} to Navient ( seven times what I owed in the beginning )? Please, help me sort this out and allow me every concession possible in order to reduce this debt to a reasonable amount. I ask that you waive fees, reduce the interest and present a payment plan that is reasonable and that also requires my ex-husband to be responsible for his portion of the debt. \n\nPlease bear in mind that I am currently unemployed due to XXXX XXXX wickedness and I explain : XXXX and I have an XXXX  son of whom we share a joint custody.

Every year I timely file my paper work, yet Navient systematically ignores the receipt of the documents allowing the deadline to lapse which results in a capitalization of the interest. After the first occurrence of this in XX/XX/XXXXI would make repeated calls to the Navient after sending my proof of income to ensure that this would not occur. In general it would require 3 to 4 calls insisting that the paper work had been sent in a timely fashion and demanding that the acknowledge receipt of the documents and officially update their records to indicate that they had received it. This was an incredibly frustrating process and it was clear by their actions that Navient have been acting in a bad faith. It was not a one time occurrence, I faced this same scenario every year when attempting to renew my income driven repayment plan. Although this was a nightmare to deal with I thought my persistence had prevented any further unwarranted and erroneous capitalization of interest. However, due to my mistake I did not regularly check on my loan balances and aside from my yearly fight to remain in the income driven repayment plan I did not pay close attention. Recently I checked my loan balance and noticed it was much higher than I recalled and was able to determine they had capitalized interest in XX/XX/XXXX. I know that I had timely filed my paper work as I do every year. I think it is telling that my final payment of the prior year was processed, interest was capitalized and days later my payment was adjusted for my new income.

My story is sad but true. It's like millions of others, I'm sure but still no less sad because it is my own issue. My own life 's issue. I am an XXXX and I pursued my dream of being an XXXX  when I went to college, XXXX University, and then was accepted into the prestigious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   Graduate XXXX Program at XXXX. It was a great program and one where students were afforded many professional opportunities that many XXXX who hadn't gone to school didn't receive. I had received {$40000.00} in scholarship money to attend XXXX and I borrowed another {$40000.00} to pay for living expenses and the tuition difference for the next three years. In addition to the {$10000.00} I had taken out for XXXX study from XXXX, in XXXX I was {$50000.00} in debt with principal at 8.25 % interest. I also had taken out a Perkins loan for {$2500.00} that I had paid off within five years of graduation. After graduating XXXX, I worked in theater steadily for the next three years. My salary at $ XXXX week wasn't tremendous but I was a working XXXX! After the 6 month grace period however my loan servicer, then Sallie Mae, told me I would owe $ XXXXmonth on top of my rent and bills but if that would be a problem they said I could defer payments for upto 2 years or I could \" forbear '' payments, essentially stopping payments, basically so I would not have to worry about payments. As the years went by I had to keep forbearing or deferring payments. My loans were bought and sold as so much trash by XXXX, Navient, Sallie Mae, and finally Navient again. I'm sure there were other servicers who bought the loans but I can not rememember all of them. They seemed to change each or every other year. I would constantly ask for statements at the end of the deferrment period to see how much interest was 'capitalized ' to the principal but most of the servicer 's employees were from XXXX and either they didn't understand what I meant when I said, \" Please send me a paper statement when the loan is about to start repayment so I can see how much interest has accrued '' or they just disregarded it as unimportant. It was probably the latter as I'm sure many of us asked for statements but because the loans had switched hands so much the servicers only needed to get permission to defer or forbear payments and then forget about the rest of the service call. Their bank was getting what they wanted. People whose initial principal wasn't enormous, although owing {$50000.00} is pretty enormous would see the balance balloon to enormous sums because we weren't being kept aware of how the principal kept growing. The agents were always so understanding and supportive on the call about giving out more deferment or forbearance time because we needed help. Outside of paying my rent on a New York rent stabilized apt , borrowing for school has been my only borrowing experience. Fast forward to some years later when I was in a long running play, or on tour and I would have a modest steady income and I would try and knock off some of the principal but the interest alone now was over {$1000.00} so I asked about repayment options. I was put on income sensitive plans or income contingent plans and had some years where I was able to pay some of the loan 's interest back but unfortunately those plan were not the 'right income sensitive ' plan to qualify for payments towards loan forgiveness. Once again, misleading information that is only found out years later when the issue is too big now to be ignored and I'm trying to figure out a way out of this mess. As it stands right now I have about two, maybe three years towards loan forgiveness. My principal is now {$90000.00}! I am in the \" REPAYE '' plan which I need to reapply for each year. This year my payment was $ XXXX month based on my expenses and income from the previous year however I'm still not paying anything toward taking down the principal so the interest gets added to the amount and the amount keeps growing. I'm XXXX years old. Still an XXXX. I make around XXXX/year between XXXX work, side gigs like XXXX, and unemployment but it changes every year and I don't receive a weekly check like a banker. I get paid for something then I have to stretch that money out to pay health insurance/medical costs, union dues, not to mention rent, bills and the occasional piece of pizza. I live in XXXX which is very expensive. I have under {$10000.00} in retirement savings and with streaming media taking away a lot of union work XXXX in commercials things have been getting worse and worse in the last 5 years. Producers and ad agencies don't care about XXXX. There aren't government regs to restrict this from happening and our union is virtually a non factor in protecting our livliehood. I yearn for a night when I can sleep through without waking up in an anxious sweat. I have this {$90000.00} debt hanging over my head with no real possibility to pay it off in my lifetime. I'm wondering how I could have let this happen but more importantly, I'm wondering why there aren't any regulations in place to protect borrowers from this sort of practice. The 'ever polite and supportive bank who says, \" You can have another forbearance, no problem ''. Additionally, had I been told about the \" proper '' repayment plan to be on years ago, I would have a few more years invested in the loan forgiveness program and I would not be staring down this dark tunnel. Had their practices been less predatory in a 'folksy kind of way ' but instead 'transparent in an honest way ', I would not be 25 years out of graduate school looking at double the amount I borrowed with not very good prospects to pay it all off.</td><td>List(hello, stori, true, like, million, sure, still, less, issu, life, issu, dream, went, colleg, univers, accept, prestigi, graduat, program, great, program, mani, profession, mani, gone, school, didnt, receiv, receiv, scholarship, money, attend, anoth, live, tuition, differ, next, three, addit, taken, studi, debt, princip, interest, also, taken, loan, within, five, graduat, graduat, work, theater, steadili, next, three, salari, week, wasnt, tremend, work, month, grace, period, howev, loan, told, would, rent, would, problem, said, could, defer, could, forbear, essenti, stop, basic, would, worri, went, keep, forbear, bought, sold, much, trash, final, sure, bought, chang, everi, year, would, constant, period, much, interest, princip, either, didnt, understand, meant, said, pleas, send, paper, statement, loan, start, repay, much, interest, unimport, probabl, latter, sure, mani, switch, much, permiss, defer, forbear, forget, rest, servic, call, bank, get, peopl, whose, initi, princip, wasnt, enorm, although, owe, pretti, enorm, would, balanc, balloon, enorm, werent, kept, awar, princip, kept, grow, alway, understand, support, call, give, defer, forbear, time, help, outsid, pay, rent, york, rent, borrow, school, borrow, experi, fast, forward, later, long, run, play, tour, would, modest, steadi, incom, would, knock, princip, interest, alon, repay, incom, sensit, incom, conting, abl, loan, interest, back, unfortun, plan, right, incom, sensit, plan, qualifi, toward, loan, forgiv, mislead, inform, found, later, issu, tri, figur, mess, right, mayb, three, toward, loan, forgiv, princip, plan, need, reappli, year, year, payment, month, base, incom, previous, year, howev, still, pay, anyth, toward, take, princip, interest, ad, amount, amount, grow, still, make, around, work, side, like, unemploy, everi, year, dont, receiv, week, check, like, banker, someth, stretch, money, health, union, mention, rent, occasion, piec, pizza, live, expens, retir, stream, media, take, away, union, work, get, wors, wors, last, dont, care, arent, govern, restrict, happen, union, virtual, factor, protect, yearn, night, sleep, without, wake, anxious, sweat, debt, hang, head, real, possibl, lifetim, wonder, could, happen, import, wonder, arent, place, protect, sort, practic, ever, polit, support, bank, anoth, forbear, problem, addit, told, proper, repay, plan, would, loan, forgiv, program, would, stare, dark, tunnel, less, predatori, folksi, kind, instead, transpar, honest, would, graduat, school, look, doubl, amount, good)</td></tr><tr><td>I have 5 student loans through XXXX XXXX.

I tried to refinance my loans to be income based with several other lenders, but I didn't quality for any of them because my credit score is too low. I then called XXXX XXXX to ask them to put me on income based payments. They said they don't do that because they are private loans, but that they could put me on graduated interest payments for 12 months. That only lowered my monthly payment by {$170.00}. When I asked what other options they had for me, the only thing they offered was to move my payment for this month to the end of my loans, but the interest will still add up.

I called Nelnet, and was told I COULD qualify for REPAYE, but would be charged XXXX to \" make a change. '' I asked to speak to management because 1. I had been told prior I did not qualify for REPAYE, but was not given any solution ( the solution would have been to switch my XXXX loans from IBR to REPAYE early in the process and avoid \" making a change '' penalties '' ) Additionally, I was told I still needed to send in a self certified letter to qualify for IBR, which I had been stalling on so I could gather all this information and do my own research before finalizing it, after becoming aware of all the \" change '' penalties, and having made the unfortunate discovery that Nelnet servicers would tell me something different every time. So come yesterday, somehow I am fully locked into IBR and will need to pay penalties to switch to REPAYE. If I had been given the correct guidance from the very start there would be no 22k penalty, however 3 different loan servicers lead me to believe that IBR was the only way and i was stuck paying a third the balance on IBR with a wildly snowballing principal. I confirmed this fact w the penultimate phone call and NO ONE EVER SAID, hey wait you will avoid having a huge balance in 25 years if you do REPAYE instead. These people apparently think we are dealign with XXXX money and that it's ok to have people that don't understand finance from a long term standpoint dishing out instructions and advice that have horrible long term consequences.

I did some research and found out that when you student loans are in default you can not quality for any of the same programs like income based repayment that would be available if my loan was still with The Department Of Education - so clearly I was being fed lies. After figuring out Student Loan Financial Assistance is a scam, I have been able to find a solution on my own to resolve my debt with the collection agency in charge of my student loan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ).

I told XXXX that there had been a mistake, that my normal payment ( {$230.00} ) ought to have been paid through auto pay for the XX/XX/XXXXpayment per my instructions, and that I was prepared to make a one-time payment to satisfy my monthly XX/XX/XXXXpayment. I further told XXXX that there was no justification for Navient to be recapitalizing any part of my loan, since I had timely given Navient the information to auto debit my XX/XX/XXXXpayment. XXXX took my bank information, and {$230.00} was debited from my bank. ( Screencap of bank website excerpt, Ex. B ).

XXXX confirmed this, and gave me the confirmation number # XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/2019, I received an alert from my bank that Navient had auto debited my account in the amount of {$230.00} -- the incorrect amount reflecting an unauthorized recapitalization of interest.

I called XXXX XXXX  and stated that I had 6 1/2 years worth of payments that were missing from that number. They told me that my previous loan servier, XXXX, never sent over the information.

I was told they have over half a million accounts that they are processing with limited staff and I just need to be patient. I was told the requests are processed in the order they were received. So I asked if they could tell me where I stood in the line of people, whether there was a number in a queue, and their response was \" no, I don't know where you are in line ''. I explained that this is incredibly frustrating and concerning that 6 years worth of payments are essentially being held hostage because their company can't process anything in a timely manner. I asked if this is why only 1 % of people are actually receiving forgiveness, because they are taking so long to process information? I was told the actual application for forgiveness is a separate process that involves my account being reviewed AGAIN, and that could take up to 6 months. \n\nSo now I sit here with 6 years worth of payments not being accounted for, being managed by a company who can't give me any information about where I stand or how long it could take to verify all those payments and all I can do is wait.

Both times, the agent went back into the XXXX XXXX profile and saw my payments made under XXXX XXXX, but before they credited those monthly payments, they disconnected the phone and did not call me back. Each of these calls took about 45 minutes, and that was my whole lunch break, so I could not call back. On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote a letter to XXXX   XXXX regarding this, and I have received no response back. I would like XXXX XXXX to properly credit my monthly payments made while working in public service. \n\nAnother issue is that for years, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX refused to send the applications out for loan recertification. After I would call and beg for the applications and supposedly get sent the applications in the mail, which I never received, and then begged for the sites for the applications, I would always send in my applications on time. But it would take these servicers a ridiculous amount of time to \" process '' what my new payment amount would be. Because they didn't know what my new annual payment was going to be, I had the option of making a full standard payment, which was basically all my earnings for a month, or going on forbearance, and not having that month count toward my PSLF. This is also an unfair practice, when the rubric for calculating a monthly payment is so simple and completely in control of the servicer. XXXX XXXX has since changed this, requiring documents to be sent in sooner, so they could process the new payment amounts by XX/XX/XXXX or so, but I believe those months spent working in public service and having to go on forbearance because the servicers couldn't properly process the payments on a timely application should also be counted towards my 120 payment total. This happened for four years, resulting in 4 months less counted. If they did this for 10 years, it would take just about a whole extra year to achieve forgiveness, which is not fair.</td><td>List(origin, believ, consolid, pursu, public, servic, loan, forgiv, work, sinc, submit, annual, certif, count, public, servic, time, tri, resolv, time, agent, went, back, profil, made, month, disconnect, phone, call, back, took, whole, lunch, break, could, call, back, wrote, letter, regard, receiv, respons, back, would, like, proper, credit, month, made, work, public, servic, anoth, issu, send, loan, would, call, suppos, sent, mail, never, receiv, would, alway, send, time, would, take, ridicul, amount, time, process, payment, amount, would, didnt, know, annual, payment, go, option, make, full, standard, payment, basic, earn, month, go, forbear, month, count, toward, also, unfair, practic, rubric, calcul, month, payment, simpl, complet, control, sinc, sent, sooner, could, process, payment, believ, spent, work, public, servic, forbear, proper, process, time, applic, also, toward, payment, total, four, result, less, would, take, whole, extra, year, achiev, forgiv, fair)</td></tr><tr><td>I was garnished and am trying to contact companyvto work w them and get basic info on acct.

I am now a XXXX XXXX veteran ( XXXX XXXX ), no longer able to work due to multiple XXXX conditions. Financial Aid requested I needed additional money to cover the expenses for an XXXX Degree since my GI Bill did not cover and was informed I could get aide through federal loans. I did receive these loans but was informed I needed a co-signer to cover the remaining tuition, thus my deceased step-father did for me. There are no financial statements of payments from the XXXX GI Bill, Federal Loans or Sallie Mae Private Loans. After graduating, in XX/XX/XXXX, my loans had reached the grace period and I began making payments. I was unaware at the time the Sallie Mae loans were from a private lender and not federal subsidized loans, the university referenced the loans as \" federal loans ''. The university sales representative promised employment after graduation then later coaxed me into pursuing a XXXX Degree in XXXX but I soon dropped out for medical reasons. After graduation in XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to find employment through the school and on my own but remained unemployed for almost 2 years. In XX/XX/XXXX, I relocated to MD as a result of unemployment and Sallie Mae reported negatively on my credit although they were aware of my unemployment and inability to pay at that time and was told I did not qualify for a deferment but a forbearance with a {$100.00} fee. My financial hardships, medical hardships and hospitalizations, Navient provided minimal repayment options after calculating my expenses and still requesting payments beyond my ability to pay. Requests to correct inaccuracies on my credit report, arrange agreeable payment terms and options, or to be placed in a reduced payment program were fruitless. I was forced to setup automatic payments after being denied a forbearance according to Navient payment terms and conditions which they stated says no forbearance requests would be approved if the borrower has exceeded a 36 month time-frame regardless of the original disbursement of the loan, even if due to unemployment nor was a copy of these terms provided as stated to be in the promissory note, from the previous servicer, Sallie Mae. I struggled to repay my loans and only once placed in an interest-only payment plan for 1 year only in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX,  which thereafter I qualified for no other programs, even Income-Based Repayment. Confirmation # XXXX for {$220.00} was applied and the previous auto-payment agreement was removed. My D, of ED-Navient were favorably deferred during this time. In XX/XX/XXXX, my step-father ( co-signer ) died and again had troubles with harassing calls, illegal correspondence to my deceased father after providing a copy of the death certificate. I made three-payments to enter a program with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to have automatic withdrawals for of various amounts to catch up. XX/XX/XXXX, I became very ill due to my XXXX during the XXXX XXXX XXXX. My auto-debit was cancelled in the amount of {$220.00} with XXXX XXXX. I was transferred to the military department to see if I could get my loans reevaluated but was told by XXXX, to pay {$220.00} by the XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI am currently pursuing XXXX as a result of being unable to find sustainable employment to accommodate my medical conditions and after having credit inaccuracies removed from my credit through XXXX XXXX XXXX. Today, the Lender informed me that there were charge-offs for three accounts on my XXXX  credit report. However, I never received any notice of a charge-off to my account via email or mail. The three letters that were obtained from Navient website, sent to my old address, although updated online, were after my attempts to make arrangements and their refusal to offer payment options due to my unemployment. XXXX ( XXXX ) stated on XX/XX/XXXX, that she would note my account of the financial and medical circumstances but no payment options or delayed payments were offered. Letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX stated only being delinquent and final notice threats to pay and to be sent to litigation. XXXX XXXX confirmed removal of these three negative marks on my XXXX credit report in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nDue to losing all of my federal TSP retirement to pay medical, relocation and other financial obligations to avoid homelessness, I submitted a request for loan discharge on XX/XX/XXXX for loan discharge however it was not processed. Please review this complaint in reference to improper tactics for Signature Loans, Sallie Mae and Navient for harassment, denial of forbearance requests, denial of attempts to make payment arrangements, reduced payments or deferment during unemployment, financial and medical hardships and threat tactics of litigation, false credit reporting and misrepresentation of loan types.</td><td>List(enrol, univers, former, univers, sought, financi, aid, usag, bill, veteran, longer, abl, work, multipl, financi, addit, money, cover, degre, sinc, bill, cover, inform, could, aid, feder, receiv, inform, cosign, cover, tuition, thus, deceas, stepfath, financi, bill, feder, privat, graduat, grace, period, make, unawar, time, privat, lender, feder, univers, feder, univers, repres, employ, graduat, later, degre, soon, medic, graduat, find, employ, school, unemploy, almost, result, unemploy, negat, credit, although, awar, unemploy, inabl, time, told, qualifi, defer, forbear, financi, medic, provid, minim, repay, calcul, still, beyond, abil, correct, credit, report, arrang, agreeabl, payment, reduc, payment, program, fruitless, forc, setup, automat, forbear, accord, payment, state, forbear, would, borrow, month, regardless, origin, disburs, loan, even, unemploy, copi, provid, state, promissori, note, previous, repay, payment, plan, year, thereaft, qualifi, even, repay, confirm, appli, previous, agreement, remov, favor, defer, time, stepfath, cosign, illeg, correspond, deceas, father, provid, copi, death, certif, made, enter, program, automat, various, catch, amount, transfer, militari, depart, could, told, current, result, unabl, find, sustain, employ, accommod, medic, credit, remov, credit, today, lender, inform, three, credit, report, howev, never, receiv, notic, account, mail, three, sent, address, although, make, refus, offer, payment, unemploy, state, would, note, account, financi, medic, payment, state, delinqu, final, notic, sent, litig, confirm, remov, three, negat, credit, report, lose, feder, retir, medic, reloc, financi, avoid, homeless, request, loan, discharg, loan, discharg, howev, pleas, review, complaint, refer, improp, tactic, signatur, harass, denial, forbear, denial, make, payment, reduc, defer, unemploy, financi, medic, threat, tactic, litig, fals, credit, misrepresent, loan)</td></tr><tr><td>Like many Americans, my wife and I have been paying student loan debt for the last 17 years.     During the consolidation process in the  XXXX  's our loans got locked in with 7.8 % interest rate, even though some of the loans had lower interest rates we figured it would be easier to manage the loans.   After the consolidation process-I was paying between $ 500-600 dollars a month on my student loan but because of the 7.8 % interest rate and several forbearance periods on the loans, the initial principal balance kept growing out of control. Besides the interest growing out of control it was also hard to keep track of who was servicing the loans. The loan servicers kept changing for both my wife and I, from  XXXX   XXXX  to  XXXX   XXXX  to  XXXX  to Great Lakes, etc. we were not able to keep track of the payments we had made and the manner the loan servicer was applying for our payments. Each time the loan was sold or taken over by another servicer, they only showed the amounts from the time they received the loans and did not easily include past loan info from the other servic er ( s ). At one point a l ump sum payment in the amount of {$5000.00}, to my wives loan was completely applied just to interest and we saw no real drop in the amount owed.     My wife and I suffered a tremendous loss during the financial crises of   XXXX  . Our savings and business were practically demolished. It was at this point, I reached out to my loan servicer and asked if I could negotiate a lower interest rate for the student loans, but I was denied. I was told that since we had consolidated a few years earlier, we could not reconsolidate and there were no other plans or income repayment opportunities. My only recourse was forbearance or deferment. I realize there are a number of income repayment plans now available and that works for new student loan borrowers, but it does n't do any good for older student loan borrowers that got trapped during the financial crises. Most our loans are loaded with interest and without the ability to renegotiate.   Why is it that most banks got close to 0 % interest loans to pay down their debt during the financial crises of  XXXX - XXXX , and y et US Citizens with  student loan debt were not able to get refinancing and debt relief for whatever reason and were only provided with options that increased our debt load, and is keeping us tethered to unreasonable interest rates, unreasonable length of time for paying said debt and directly affecting our ability to purchase a home or property.</td><td>List(like, mani, wife, pay, student, loan, debt, last, consolid, process, lock, interest, rate, even, though, lower, interest, figur, would, easier, manag, consolid, pay, month, student, loan, interest, rate, sever, forbear, initi, princip, balanc, kept, grow, control, besid, interest, grow, control, also, hard, keep, track, loan, kept, wife, great, abl, keep, track, made, manner, loan, time, loan, sold, taken, anoth, time, receiv, easili, includ, past, loan, point, payment, amount, loan, complet, appli, interest, real, drop, amount, wife, tremend, loss, financi, crise, busi, practic, point, loan, could, negoti, lower, interest, rate, student, told, sinc, consolid, could, reconsolid, incom, repay, recours, forbear, defer, realiz, number, incom, repay, avail, work, student, loan, good, older, student, loan, trap, financi, crise, load, interest, without, abil, renegoti, close, interest, debt, financi, crise, student, loan, debt, abl, debt, relief, whatev, reason, provid, debt, load, keep, unreason, interest, unreason, length, time, pay, said, debt, direct, affect, abil, purchas, home, properti)</td></tr><tr><td>XXXX is my loan servicer.

Now, my payment has doubled without any communication from the company. When I logged onto my account, they had put my loan in the Revised Pay as You Earn, instead of keeping the Income Based Repayment repayment plan even though my spouse and I file separate taxes. When I called the company regarding this change on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX and the large monthly amount due, the first customer service representative said that half of my consolidated loans had been taken off of income-based repayment and put back on the standard repayment plan, in addition to the other half being put on Revised Pay as You Earn. This is very alarming as it means any interest would have been capitalized and added to my loan amount as soon as the Standard Repayment was put into effect. Furthermore, this would make these loans no longer eligible for PSLF program which I am eligible for.

I was confused and angry but could not speak with the company because they were closed on the weekends. Monday morning around XXXX XXXX I called the company regarding the matter. I told them that I was not notified of a payment increase or a change in my rate reduction program. The person on the phone name was XXXX and she was very rude. She argued and told me I signed up for this and they are allowed to debit whatever amount. I was trying to explain to her that I was not notified, but she said well it was taken out of your account since last month. When she told me that I checked my account and saw that she was right. About {$440.00} was taken out automatically by check and then for some reason I paired them {$270.00} on top of it. Because she was SO rude I asked to speak with someone else. This person, XXXX, wasnt AS rude but she was not empathetic either. I asked her if I was notified that there would be a change in my payments. She said yes and told me to hold on and it took her almost 2 minutes to look. She stated she couldnt see when I was notified by it should be in my statement. I asked her how am I supposed to know when my rate reduction program ends without notification from the company? I also was confused because I did receive an email from Navient stating my program was ending XX/XX/ and my payments would be increased in XX/XX/. I submitted an updated financial statement and e-signed it. I never received a call back from Navient about that. I did not receive any notification notifying me of an increase starting in XX/XX/XXXX.

While under XXXX, I had zero issues. However, that company underwent a buyout and in the process of doing so sold some of their loans to UNISAINC. UNISAINC makes almost no effort to indicate that payments are due - the only notification from them that either I or my girlfriend ( who also has loans serviced by them ) are letters in the mail that often arrive on the date of or after the payment due date informing us that we owe money. Since both of us are proactive, this isn't a huge problem for us personally but could be one for other borrowers. Our main problem is in how difficult UNISAINC makes payments. Every. Single. Time. I go to make a payment online, their website is having issues. Sometimes it will log you out for clicking the wrong link. It is frustratingly slow. They make it difficult to access the payment page. Most frustratingly, there are entire *weeks* where you can not access their website. I understand that the CPFB is better able to serve with specific information - however, there are no specific dates or actions that stand out in particular. This is a repeated problem since UNISAINC has become our servicer. Unfortunately, payment by mail is not an option due to the aforementioned inability ( or unwillingness ) of UNISAINC to contact us in a timely manner. Unfortunately, payments over the phone are not an option as well since their phone lines close after work hours. Additionally, when I have made payments in the past, they have taken longer than their stated processing time to apply the payments. This has caused financial injury to me as I have overpaid as a result of their negligence. \n\nIt seems obvious to me that UNISAINC is willingly engaging in practices designed to make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their debts. \n\nAttached is a collection of receipts from UNISAINC and a screencap taken as I tried to log in to my account and pay on XX/XX/2018</td><td>List(direct, student, loan, zero, howev, compani, underw, process, sold, almost, effort, indic, notif, either, also, mail, often, arriv, date, payment, date, money, sinc, huge, problem, person, could, main, problem, difficult, everi, singl, time, make, payment, sometim, wrong, link, slow, make, difficult, access, payment, page, entir, access, understand, better, abl, serv, specif, inform, howev, specif, stand, particular, repeat, problem, sinc, becom, unfortun, payment, mail, option, inabl, unwilling, contact, time, manner, unfortun, phone, option, well, sinc, phone, close, work, addit, made, past, taken, longer, state, time, appli, financi, injuri, result, neglig, obvious, will, engag, design, make, difficult, repay, attach, collect, receipt, taken, tri, account)</td></tr><tr><td>Withdrew prior to disbursement in XX/XX/2008 and school knew i would not be employable even with education due to criminal record</td><td>List(prior, disburs, school, knew, would, employ, even, educ, crimin, record)</td></tr><tr><td>I have several late payments from Navient on my credit report and I do not know why.

This is my error, of which I am deeply embarrassed, but I did not know it was a garnishment of wages, rather than a monthly direct payment. The balance according to their records was {$23000.00}. I contacted the loan servicer, XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, requesting a lower payment and this is when I discovered that the LAST 5 YEARS of payments were made under a garnishment. The conversation was if I made the payments for the next 3 months on time I could get a smaller payment ( from nearly {$400.00} to less than {$200.00} ). I was also told in that conversation that if I had a total of 120 payments on the books on time, I could probably get the rest forgiven. My loan was transferred to Navient, effective XX/XX/XXXX,  where I have faithfully made my payments. Between XX/XX/XXXX and now, I had read on the website about loan forgiveness that you had to start one year before your 10th year to  begin the process. In XX/XX/XXXX, I went online, downloaded the form to begin the forgiveness process and mailed the form in. I received a response that my loan was not in the database. I called the phone number given, and a rep named XXXX ( # XXXX ) confirmed that my loan was not in the database and transferred me over to the Public Service Forgiveness Department, where I spoke to a rep named XXXX ( # XXXX ). XXXX confirmed that my loan was not located there and she explained that my loan was not a Direct Loan and that if I requested it at that time, I could begin the process of another 120 payments for forgiveness. I told XXXX that I made payments monthly to Navient and those loans were labelled \" consolidated '', and asked what it meant. XXXX replied that was another kind of consolidation and did not qualify as the loan forgiveness qualification process. I am XXXX years old. I have faithfully paid on these loans for 10 years and then some, beginning back in XX/XX/XXXX. It is mind-boggling that I would pay two 120-payment segments on original loans, totalling {$6500.00}.

My initial request to them ( on a recorded call ) was for {$5000.00}. The representative asked several questions about my situation and advised to ensure I took out more than enough to cover any costs, as I would have to go through the application process again if I decided I needed more money. \n\nWhen asked what I qualified for, they advised me, with having my mother as a co-signer, I qualified for up to {$20000.00}. This was our qualifying amount with me being XXXX, a XXXX making about {$1100.00} a month and my mother being on social security, making less than {$1000.00} a month, and both with credit scores in the 570-650 range. \n\nOf course me being young and not knowing the long term impacts of this, I accepted. About a year later, when I needed additional funds for school, I reached out to them again, this time still making approximately the same amount of money and having my mom as a co-signer. The company allowed us to take out an additional ( approximate ) {$20000.00}, in addition to allowing my mother to co-sign on a friends student loan for {$30000.00}. \n\nAfter graduating in XXXX, I began receiving collection notices to start repayment. All of the alleged recorded calls will reflect, on numerous occasions attempted to set up a reasonable payment plan, as they were asking for approximately {$550.00} and at this time I was making around $ 1,500.00/month. The declined, were extremely intrusive and disrespectful, also declining to accept anything less than the request amount. \n\nSince I could not afford this amount, I made no payments. In XXXX, I was again contacted by a company servicing the account. After a very long conversation going rounds about why I could not afford what they requested, their initial negotiated amount was nothing less than {$250.00}. I advised I could a maximum afford {$100.00} and advised that was stretching my budget. After the rep consulted with his management, they agreed to $ XXXX/month for 3 months and then said we would reconvene at that time, as I was expecting a promotion and possibly able to afford a little more. When my third payment was made and I spoke to them again, advising my income had not changed, they declined to continue accepting the {$120.00}, insisting on a minimum of {$250.00}. After a lengthy and endless argument, I advised they could take me to court, as no judge was going to order payments for what they requesting, based on my income. \n\nI received no further notice from them until XXXX, when I was contacted by Gurstel Law Firm PC, who now owns the debt. I again attempted to negotiate an amount but they as well were adamant about nothing less than a few hundred a month. Since they refused to work with me, I refused to have further contact. \n\nAt the end of XXXX, Gurstel filed a lawsuit with the XXXX count court in XXXX, AZ. I submitted these concerns to the court as well as requested proof that they even owned the debt, as they are not who I obtained my loan from. The provided proof of ownership and from there I received a few notices of their filings and changes to documents submitted to the court and from there I attempted to contact the attorney handling the lawsuit to discuss options but those calls and emails went unreturned. Magically, the only notices I didn't receive from that point on were the ones that required me to respond to the court or I would receive a notice stating I had 10 days from the date of the document to respond but they were mailed, not served, to me, usually leaving 1-3 days to respond. Additionally, the  XXXX county court requires a {$240.00} filing fee every time I have to respond, to which I requested a fee waiver but was advised I did not meet the financial guidelines and all they could do was allow me 60 days to pay it, of which I could not afford. \n\nAfter that time, in XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice of a request for garnishment, stating I had 10 days to respond, again being mailed to me by XXXX, not the courts and was received on XX/XX/XXXX, with documents dated XX/XX/XXXX. Since I was not provided sufficient time to respond, I contacted the courts after the holidays and was advised I would have to pay the {$240.00} to file a request for a hearing, money of which I did not have. \n\nI received no further notices or calls from XXXX until today XX/XX/XXXX, which is a request for garnishment, documents dated XX/XX/XXXX, post marked XX/XX/XXXX, advising I have 10 days from the date of the letter to respond, of which again I can not afford to do, due to financial hardship. \n\nMy initial request to the courts was a reasonable repayment option, which was never responded to, only the notices of their filings and I have attempted to resolve the matter with XXXX directly. \n\nI am filing this concern with the CFPB for them to be investigated for predatory lending practices as a company and their dealing with the court in this matter, as I believe the convenient timeliness of their notices to me poses a UDAPP violation. However, I have now retained an attorney and will be proceeding with filing a lawsuit for predatory lending practices ( as outlined above, I should have never been given the amount of money I did, nor should they have allowed my mother to co-sign for almost $ 100k,  making less than $ 1k a month, on SSI, which they knew could never be garnished ).</td><td>List(privat, student, loan, cover, move, move, attend, anoth, colleg, initi, request, call, repres, sever, situat, advis, ensur, took, enough, cover, would, applic, process, decid, money, qualifi, advis, mother, cosign, qualifi, amount, make, month, mother, social, secur, make, less, month, credit, rang, cours, young, know, long, term, accept, year, later, addit, fund, school, time, still, make, approxim, amount, money, cosign, compani, take, addit, approxim, addit, mother, student, loan, graduat, collect, start, repay, reflect, numer, reason, payment, plan, approxim, time, make, around, month, declin, extrem, intrus, disrespect, also, accept, anyth, less, request, amount, sinc, could, afford, amount, made, compani, account, long, convers, go, could, afford, initi, amount, noth, less, advis, could, maximum, afford, advis, budget, manag, agre, said, would, reconven, time, promot, possibl, abl, afford, littl, third, payment, made, spoke, incom, declin, continu, minimum, lengthi, endless, argument, advis, could, take, court, judg, go, order, base, incom, receiv, notic, firm, debt, negoti, amount, well, adam, noth, less, hundr, month, sinc, work, contact, lawsuit, count, court, court, well, proof, even, debt, loan, provid, proof, ownership, receiv, file, court, contact, attorney, handl, lawsuit, discuss, went, unreturn, magic, didnt, receiv, point, respond, court, would, receiv, notic, day, date, document, respond, mail, usual, leav, day, respond, addit, counti, court, file, everi, time, respond, waiver, advis, meet, financi, could, allow, day, could, afford, time, receiv, notic, request, garnish, day, respond, mail, receiv, sinc, provid, suffici, time, respond, advis, would, file, request, hear, money, receiv, today, request, garnish, post, mark, day, date, letter, respond, afford, financi, hardship, initi, request, reason, repay, option, never, file, resolv, matter, direct, file, concern, predatori, compani, deal, court, matter, believ, conveni, timeli, violat, howev, attorney, proceed, file, lawsuit, predatori, outlin, never, given, amount, money, mother, almost, make, less, month, knew, could, never, garnish)</td></tr><tr><td>The company is asking for additional documentation from the City of XXXX XXXX ( which I have now provided ) and continues not honoring a year of public service - 6 months of which were under the Loan Forgiveness program.</td><td>List(compani, addit, document, citi, provid, year, public, servic, loan, forgiv, program)</td></tr><tr><td>I have a loan that originally cost {$6500.00}.

It's good that the school can not do this any longer, but I could finally have a sense of relief when that loan was paid in full.</td><td>List(main, issu, loan, taken, origin, loan, amount, last, year, loan, still, balanc, would, still, pay, loan, financi, help, long, loan, school, end, basic, scam, school, account, certif, noth, also, wast, money, interest, principl, pay, invalid, school, know, better, school, late, take, back, person, never, late, payment, good, school, longer, could, final, sens, relief, loan, full)</td></tr><tr><td>I called in on XX/XX/18 and spoke to a lady about a forbearance. She advised me that I was no longer allowed to forbear my student loans. I advised her that I have been struggling to raise a family of XXXX for the last 20yrs and I know that at some point I will have a to start paying, but not today. I still have one more child in school and hopefully after that we'll be financially stable to start paying. She said now that my loan is serviced by Navient, I am no longer to do a forbearance unless I transfer all my loans to them. I said no, that sounds like a housing refinance scam, when one servicer takes over managing an account, I have no reason why I need to refinance my student loans. She said then you have to start paying. I told her that was not acceptable. She advised she can do an emergency forbearance for 60 days, but I had to pay {$50.00} and then decide in XXXX if I want to consolidate my student loans under Navient. I have XXXX XXXX Funds student loans from Sallie Mae. One I obtained while I was in school at the University of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Ohio and the other when I went back to school with the University XXXX XXXX ( online ) to finish up my bachelors. As head of household, mother of 3, I had to finish getting my bachelors in order to provide for my family. Though the years, I've been able to progress in my career and am finally almost to a point where I'll be able to start being financially stable. Having to make a $ 500 monthly payment will continue to cripple our family and we'll never be able to enjoy financial stability. Again, I know eventually I'll need to start making payments, however until then, I would like to continue forbearing them until I am ready. The lady on the phone said I am limited to 60mths of forbearing, I told her I have been doing so for the last 20yrs with Sallie Mae, she said now that I am with Navient that I can't do that any more. She said the only way I can start doing it again, is if I transfer my loans to them. I'm concerned with losing my interest rate and any benefits of having a government student loans. I asked her to point out where in my contract that says I am limited to 60mths, and she said that she can't do that. That she's only going by her servicing rules. I told her that if that is not in my contract as a restriction, that she can not restrict me in this manner and force me to refinance. I also asked that she have someone review my contract and let me know what I am \" required '' to do.</td><td>List(spoke, ladi, forbear, advis, longer, forbear, student, advis, struggl, rais, famili, last, know, point, start, pay, today, still, child, school, hope, well, financi, stabl, start, pay, said, loan, longer, forbear, unless, transfer, said, like, hous, refin, scam, account, reason, need, refin, student, said, start, pay, told, accept, advis, emerg, forbear, day, decid, want, consolid, student, fund, student, school, univers, went, back, school, univers, finish, head, household, mother, finish, get, order, provid, famili, though, abl, progress, career, final, almost, point, abl, start, financi, stabl, make, month, payment, continu, crippl, famili, well, never, abl, enjoy, financi, stabil, know, eventu, need, start, make, howev, would, like, continu, forbear, readi, ladi, phone, said, limit, forbear, told, last, said, cant, said, start, transfer, concern, lose, interest, rate, govern, student, point, contract, limit, said, cant, go, told, contract, restrict, restrict, manner, forc, refin, also, someon, review, contract, know)</td></tr><tr><td>Hello, I am enrolled in the PSLF program through IBR.

If you start making extra payments per month, your amount owed will decrease. '' I tried to explain, THAT'S THE PROBLEM! I can't continue to make a {$770.00} per month payment every month, especially knowing I am not even hardly touching my principal! I am XXXX and need to move out of my parents house as they are retiring soon but can not because I can not afford rent with this type of payment.

I feel as though I have signed my life away, with no end in sight to this debt. I have paid faithfully since graduating in XX/XX/XXXX and have NEVER, EVER missed a payment.

In addition to the master promissory note with XXXX XXXX XXXX Federal Direct Loans & XXXX promissory notes that the loan servicer required. The U.S. Department of Education is refusing to accept my proof that the only loans I had were through XXXX & they are refusing to accept that my loans were paid in full. They stated that I never had loans serviced with Navient even after I provided hard evidence and records from XXXX showing my student loan account history with XXXX and the school the loans were with which was the University of XXXX. The U. S. Department of Education is fighting against me saying that XXXX is not a Federal loan servicer for the XXXX XXXX XXXX program, but it clearly states that XXXX is on the .gov website. On the government free website under the loan servicer chart Navient is listed as a loan servicer. My student loans through XXXX were paid in full as of XXXX. The U.S. Department of Education then stated in a letter that my loans were transferred XX/XX/XXXX to Federal Loan Servicing the same year I finished paying the exact same loans off in full to XXXX. In order for my loans or loan information to have been transferred to XXXX XXXX database it had to come from somewhere. That somewhere originally being XXXX. The U.S. Department of Education is currently taking money out of my paycheck through wage garnishment and taking all of my tax refund money to pay towards loans that have already been paid in full.

Even more, to compound this grievance, I feel Ive been abandoned by the very same Bureau ( the CFPB ) that was created to serve as my advocate, and tasked by Congress to protect me from such blatant exploitation! \n\nAfter experiencing the aggravation firsthand, over the course of a few years ; after having to deal with the mandates of Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and, particularly, how this is interpreted by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a contracted company the Department of Education has asked to handle the administration and customer service for its PSLF program ), I felt I could sit idly and silently no longer. \n\nThe abbreviated version of events : I was recruited to work for a rural XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ). Part of the recruiting pitch ( and part of the allure ) was that my student debt would be forgiven after ten years of service, if I came to work for them, being that they are a qualified county facility. In other words, if I came to work for them and continued to make my loan payments, whatever balance remained, so I was told, after ten years of service, then that remaining balance would be forgiven. What a recruiting pitch! This sounded great. I did some research into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and sure enough if I worked for a public service-eligible XXXX  ( which this was ) then my debt would be forgiven after 120 payments. So, with this lucrative perk in mind, I accepted the position to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I decided to relocate, dragging my family 1,800 miles across the country, moving from XXXX XXXX to the XXXX XXXX. \n\nI moved in XX/XX/XXXX, and started working the following month. It took from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to be placed into an eligible PSLF repayment program ( 12 months! ). Thats a whole year ; ten percent of the time I was supposed to be working in a qualified environment. For some reason, my spouses employment status prevented me from being put into an eligible program. Why would my husbands employment status be a deciding factor, delaying my enrollment? The program clearly states that I only need to be working at a qualified facility for a requisite length of time ( and be enrolled in a qualified repayment plan ). My husband was out of work when we applied, and this fact somehow disqualified me from consideration! Why? This was the first major red flag that something was amiss, and rotten in the state of XXXX. \n\nAgain, I was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ), to be their full-time XXXX XXXX, working 40 hours a week. I took this position based in part by the false promise of the PSLF program, believing that my student debt would be forgiven after ten years of service/payments I was working at a public service XXXX when I applied for PSLF ; my employer certified the necessary documents immediately. Still, I was denied because I was told they couldnt certify my husbands employer. I told them he was unemployed and nothing but crickets and denials. An entire year went by until I was placed in a PSLF qualified repayment plan. \n\nAnd, how did I finally get accepted? Lo and behold, when my husband was hired to work in XXXX, XXXX, at the end of XX/XX/XXXX then, suddenly, I was approved and enrolled into an eligible PSLF repayment program. HOWEVER, at this time, somehow the proverbial they decided to recalculate how much I would owe on a monthly basis. Based on some unknown algorithm, a figure that determines my households ability to repay, my monthly payments ballooned from {$340.00} a month to {$560.00}. This doesnt sound like a loan forgiveness plan It sounds like, OK let us re-amortize your loan, figure out what amount you need to pay to pay-off the loan in 120 payments, with the service provider grabbing their 33 % markup in profits ( off the interest ). This is a total bait and switch. Its actually mocking me when the PSLF uses the word forgiveness because there isnt a penny thats being forgiven. I am paying off the loan, in its entirety. \n\nThe parameters are clear : Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a federal program that ( supposedly ) forgives federal student loans for borrowers who are employed full-time ( 30+ hours a week ) in an eligible federal, state, or local public service job. Where in this does it stipulate that your spouse must be working? Where does it state that the program will review your households annual income and then determine how much you owe, per month, based on your households financial vitality? Why does this matter? Why should it? The program was established to help certain facilities and regions attract talented candidates this is the spirit that led to the creation of the program. Its supposed to be an added benefit, not an aggravation! \n\nHOW IS IT THAT THIS IS CONSIDERED LOAN FORGIVENESS? \n\nIn other words, heres what the actions of PSLF are stating loudly to me : Go work in public service and qualify for loan forgiveness and then pay nearly seventy thousand dollars on a XXXX XXXX   dollar balance. And, to mock you, we will call this a loan forgiveness. This isnt forgiveness, this is merely paying off a loan in ten years!\n\nThis is blatant bait-and-switch. This is fine print nonsense. There is no loan forgiveness being offered here. This is simply taking a 20-year loan repayment plan and changing it to a 10-year loan payment plan. I never would have moved halfway across the country, moved to a rural community, if I knew this was what the PSLF offered. This spits in the face of the idea of loan forgiveness and betrays the intent behind the creation of such a program to begin with. Again, I ask : how is this a reward for public service?\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of my plight, allow me to expound on the particulars : My name is XXXX XXXX. I graduated, with degree, from the XXXX  XXXX University XXXX program ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX. During my schooling, I amassed approximately {$46000.00} in student loan debt. ( This was a wise investment in my future, on my part, because XXXX   is a fruitful career path with lots of job openings and opportunities ; According to a XXXX report from XXXX, the median annual income for an XXXX was nearly {$82000.00} ). \n\nImmediately after graduation, in XX/XX/XXXX, I began working as an XXXX for a XXXX, XXXX  based XXXX -- XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Then, six months later, I began to make my student debt payments, promptly, after my initial grace period expired. \n\nInitially, I enrolled in the 20-year plan. I did this to keep my payments as low as possible ( even though this repayment plan incurred the biggest interest cost ). I was fine with this, and with paying the enormous interest, because I knowingly entered into this obligation understanding the liability I was taking on. Like I wrote earlier, this was an investment in my future and it was worth it. Sure, I was perplexed to understand a system where the government would loan money to banks at zero percent interest rate, then those banks turn around and lend that money out at interest to students ( to encourage banks to lend money to students for education ). I mean, shouldnt the government simply loan money directly to students, so the government could earn the usury profits, and so students would receive the lowest interest rate possible )? Doesnt that make more sense, for a government of, by, and for the taxpaying people. \n\nFrom XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, over the first 53 months paying back my student loans, I made every monthly payment. My payments were in the {$340.00} range. I paid approximately {$18000.00} over the course of these fifty-three payments ( of which only {$4200.00} went towards principal, and {$14000.00} going towards the interest ). \n\nI moved to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I began working at my new position that XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, for almost 6 months, I was attempting in vain to enroll in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Even though I was eligible, and shouldve qualified without incident, I was denied about three times because there was an apparent issue with my husbands work. When we moved, my husband was no longer employed. He was working full-time in XXXX, at a XXXX XXXX, but when we moved to XXXX  he didnt have employment ( other than XXXX  XXXX work he did, for about 6K a year ). He wrote a letter and said as much, but we still couldnt qualify The PSLF program wouldnt approve my application because of some hiccup with my husband, which to this day I have no idea what the issue was. I was told they couldnt verify employment, even though I constantly told them that my husband wasnt employed ( at the time of my application ). \n\nAnyway, in XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were consolidated from XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Against my wishes, I was enrolled in a program that didnt qualify for the PSLF. My payment was about {$320.00}. I called for the umpteenth time Anyway, that XX/XX/XXXX my husband was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX. And, would you believe, this was when the PSLF program finally approved my application. Now that my husband was working, for some particularly strange reason, the program accepted my application! Why would my husbands employment status determine my eligibility? \nSo, after certifying my employment at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and calibrating what the PSLF deemed I was mandated to pay monthly, I was finally enrolled into the PSLF program in XX/XX/XXXX ( one year after I began the enrollment process ). And, guess what my payments were tallied at {$560.00} dollars a month! What a joke. How is it that this is considered loan forgiveness?\n\nIn essence, 120 payments of {$560.00} comes to about {$67000.00}. When I consolidated my loans into this PSLF program, I owed {$46000.00}. This was more than my original loan amount ( because after 4.5 years of payments, most of my payments when towards paying the interest down ). So, when I accepted the job at a rural XXXX, and got excited when I heard about the PSLF perk, little did I know that loan forgiveness meant paying {$67000.00} over 120 payments to pay off the existing {$46000.00} balance.\n\nChanging the loan from a 20-year payment plan to a 10-year payment plan is not loan forgiveness. At the end of my 120 PSLF payments, altogether, going back to when I first began paying off my debt, I wouldve ended up paying {$85000.00} total in payments, from the time I made my first payment in XX/XX/XXXX. Nearly {$86000.00} dollars on a {$46000.00} loan! \n\nBut, the part that aggravates me most, is the misleading fact that I enrolled in the PSLF program, owing just {$46000.00}, and the PSLF program upped my payments from {$340.00} to {$560.00}. In essence, the program demands that I pay about {$67000.00} over ten years, and has the gall to deem this loan forgiveness. \n\nIn conclusion, contending with the deceitful fine-print and the legalistic tentacles of the program has weakened my faith and trust in the Department of Education in general ( and the student loan industry specifically ). The financial turmoil spawned by the false promise of the PSLF program has directly impacted my familys standard of living, while, on a more personal level, the emotional distress caused by the misleading PSLF propaganda has wreaked havoc on my gastrointestinal tract. Just the mere thought of the programs criminal bait- & -switch violations, no matter when the thought surfaces, irritates me beyond repair. What does this say about the student loan industry? When a GAO report discovers that 99 % of applications have been denied ( 29,000 applications denied! ), I worry about what will happen when I make my 120th payment. Im upset now, after only 30 payments ( only 1/4th of the way thru ) I dont trust the PSLF program, and Im already bracing myself for more trouble when I make my final ( 120th ) payment. I dont trust that the Department of Education will honor their pledge. To be frank, I have zero faith that the PSLF will live up to its obligation. If it took over a year to qualify and enroll in the PSLF repayment service, I fear what awaits for me down the line.</td><td>List(upon, read, resign, letter, last, former, student, loan, ombudsman,

The rep highlighted NONE of the effects of the plan other than the monthly payment, and due to distractions at the time and the reps persistence I agreed to the consolidation. When I realized they had added almost {$30000.00} in capitalization costs and fees and my balance was now nearly {$120000.00} at the same interest, I called ( XX/XX/2018 ) to see if they could work with me in some way to reverse/reduce the amount. They refused. I called again a few days later and requested the same, and also highlighted my concerns about pressured and potentially unscrupulous lending tactics, their response was to send me a copy of my promissory note! I called one more time ( Fall 2018 ) to ask again for help, reminding them I have XXXX kids and only make $ XXXX ( I've since become unemployed unfortunately ), and that the loan had placed devastatingly undue hardship upon my family.

After the 10 years, all of my student loans would be forgiven. The only catch is that I have to make 6 payments of $ XXXX/month so they can certify that my loan payment is {$0.00}. After that, it would be $ XXXX/month for the next 10 years, but that will not go for my loans, only in their pockets. What I later realized, was that my loans are serviced through XXXX XXXX, and this particular third party company is not affiliated with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX did see my balance of {$0.00} towards my student loans, but did not see any other transactions taken out. I am in a grace period, and I am not required to make any payments at this time, so this company took over {$1100.00} of my money that is not even going towards my student loans.

Www.unisainc.com.  I have had consistent problems with them processing my automatic payments to a consistent schedule. They claim it is impossible to predict when my payment will be deducted from my bank account. It is a considerable amount of money, so it is very important to me to know when I will be debited. I have talked to them in person, but they say can not be resolved. \n\nOn XX/XX/2018, I was debited my full amount and then on XX/XX/XXXX I was debited the full amount again. My payment is only supposed to be paid once a month. I called their customer service on XX/XX/XXXX as their website had no record of the second payment being authorized. I was accused of authorizing the payment on my own, which I did not do. The person I talked to said he could see the payments in his system. He did apologize and told me they would count the second payment towards XX/XX/XXXX and not debit me again until XX/XX/XXXX. I agreed. Again, no date was given when payments would be processed when I asked. \n\nToday on XX/XX/XXXX, I was debited for my usual XX/XX/XXXX payment. As of today, there is no record on their website showing this payment. Only in my online banking. \n\nAnother consistent problem is Unisa never displays the correct amount of my automatic debits. I have three loans with them which are debited from my bank account as a lump sum. Their system only shows one loan amount as being debited, not the full amount of the lump sum. Each of the three loans are different amounts and it appears to be random which amount will be shown in their online account history. I complained during my phone call with them on XX/XX/XXXX, but was told the customer service rep could see the proper amounts being debited from my account and offered no reason why the online system does not display the full amounts. He just told me not to worry about it. I do not know if Unisa has been calculating my payments properly against my loan as their system does not display the correct information. I do not trust them, but can not afford to pay my balance outright. \n\nI have also tried to add Unisa to my home accounting software and it never shows up as being a legitimate business.

She said that one I made that first payment of the new payment plan, it would \" kick start '' and my account would go current. So I asked if I could go ahead and make the payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX, I made another payment to start my newest payment plan. She said I would get the terms and conditions in 3-4 business days and it would reflect on my account. I kept telling her I did not want this to go on my credit. She assured me it would not. I have checked my account since then, and it had never said current. It always said past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a delinquent letter. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that the new payment plan did not go through, AGAIN. I asked to speak to a supervisor. This woman stated that it was a new type of loan ( even though they have had this loan for 2 years ) and there was no possible way for me to get a repayment plan or new terms. I asked for deferment for 9 months - 1 year, and all she said was are you able to make the payment to catch your loan up? I asked her why no one has tried to call and tell me any of this and why I had been told that I would have a new payment plan so many times and she just kept saying she apologized for the inconvenience. I have been promised 3 different times a new repayment plan. And now there could possibly be a delinquent report on my credit. All I wanted was to defer or lower my payments until my husband could work full time again. I am thoroughly disappointed in the unprofessionalism of this company.</td><td>List(knew, would, abl, afford, payment, husband, work, part, time, medic, health, twice, person, state, payment, go, receiv, statement, go, week, resolv, issu, first, call, payment, plan, given, confirm, number, told, first, instal, payment, plan, went, woman, accept, said, reflect, account, busi, day, gave, day, account, still, state, full, amount, back, person, spoke, told, repay, plan, tri, call, time, phone, number, disconnect, definit, number, sinc, payment, plan, confirm, number, went, condit, first, instal, instal, week, first, payment, anoth, payment, plan, said, would, reflect, busi, day, gave, busi, day, account, still, behind, back, person, phone, said, depart, still, work, call, back, check, state, worri, call, back, check, payment, plan, day, later, still, show, back, person, said, payment, plan, knew, make, happen, plan, went, anoth, confirm, number, payment, plan, day, later, past, origin, date, payment, past, back, spoke, anoth, woman, incred, rude, speak, manag, manag, came, explain, go, said, made, first, payment, payment, plan, would, kick, start, account, would, current, could, ahead, make, payment, made, anoth, payment, start, payment, plan, said, would, busi, day, would, reflect, account, kept, tell, want, credit, assur, would, check, account, sinc, never, said, current, alway, said, past, receiv, delinqu, letter, told, payment, plan, speak, supervisor, woman, state, type, loan, even, though, loan, possibl, repay, plan, defer, year, said, abl, make, payment, catch, loan, tri, call, tell, told, would, payment, plan, mani, time, kept, say, inconveni, differ, time, repay, plan, could, possibl, delinqu, report, credit, defer, lower, husband, could, work, full, time, thorough, disappoint, unprofession, compani)</td></tr><tr><td>I have had this problem for over a year now ...

XXXX had me in the most expensive IBR instead of REPAY. I requested the least expensive option when I applied for the initial IBR from XXXX   because I was going to apply for public service loan forgiveness after 120 payments. \nMy original payment was hundreds of dollars more than it should have been but I trusted that XXXX knew what they were doing. I had to have my payment recalculated last year to the repay IBR and it took so long to process Fedloan Services was sending me payment notifications for $ 1400+. Then when my payment was finally recalculated they made it so my new payment would not count for the first month against public service loan forgiveness. I also had to request a deferment for a month for the last 2 years because it takes so long to have them process the annual recertification. Once the magical new payment is calculated there is absolutely no time to budget for the new calculated payment causing a significant hardship and payments that dont count towards PSLF because they took so long it was either enter deferment or cough up $ 1400+ for a non IBR payment until they finally figure out their recalculated payment or risk my financial future and jeprodize my security clearance. \nThere is no reason why the loan recalculation can not be done with months for the individual to plan for the new payment. \nTax filings are due every year at the same time. They are using that information to calculate the new payment. There is no reason why if it takes months for a computer system to apply some magical formula that it can not be a process that starts in XXXX, the new payment is calculated by XXXX and the individual starts paying the new payment in XXXX instead of the current process that causes absolute anxiety and unnecessary deferments. \nMy payment is always out of wack because my husband is XXXX XXXX military and his income changes depending on whether he is in a XXXX XXXX and his income is used to calculate my payment creating a marriage penalty that non married individuals do not have. If they were my husbands loans SCRA would apply ; however, it doesnt even though youre using his income for payment calculations. So it is ok to put a military service member in a financial hardship if it is the military spouses loans but not ok if its their loans. If the military service members income is used to calculate my payment then SCRA should apply regardless of whos name is on the loan. \nMy calculated payment should be based upon my income as a government employee and should not have anything to do with my spouses income because a single person paying 10 % of their disposable income pays less than what the marriage penalty is.</td><td>List(still, wait, publish, abil, recertifi, incom, incom, base, repay, plan, expens, instead, repay, least, expens, option, appli, initi, go, appli, public, servic, loan, forgiv, origin, payment, knew, payment, last, year, repay, took, long, process, send, payment, payment, final, made, payment, would, count, first, month, public, servic, loan, forgiv, also, request, defer, month, last, long, process, annual, magic, payment, calcul, absolut, time, budget, calcul, payment, caus, signific, hardship, dont, count, toward, took, long, either, enter, defer, cough, payment, final, figur, payment, risk, financi, futur, secur, clearanc, reason, loan, recalcul, done, individu, plan, payment, file, everi, year, time, inform, calcul, payment, reason, comput, system, appli, magic, formula, process, payment, calcul, individu, pay, payment, instead, current, process, absolut, anxieti, unnecessari, payment, alway, wack, husband, militari, incom, depend, whether, incom, use, calcul, payment, marriag, penalti, marri, would, appli, howev, doesnt, even, though, incom, payment, militari, servic, member, financi, hardship, militari, militari, servic, incom, use, calcul, payment, appli, regardless, name, loan, calcul, payment, base, upon, incom, govern, employe, anyth, incom, singl, person, pay, dispos, incom, less, marriag, penalti)</td></tr><tr><td>I applied for the XXXX XXXX Loan Forgiveness program and I was granted {$10000.00} in forgiveness which cleared all of my remaining debt with Navient.

However, AES did not remove the interest capitalization from XX/XX/XXXX. I called customer service again and was assured that the capitalization takes time on their end to correct but that they were aware of the problem and would fix it. \n\nIt is now XX/XX/XXXX and nothing has been done to remove the erroneously capitalized interest from my loan. I do not relish the idea of speaking to a clueless customer service agent from AES again and going through the whole story.

Within a few weeks, I called them regarding my recertification and they indicated to me a different date that was two months after the date on the document that they gave me. I told them that this was incorrect and that the date they gave me over the phone was in conflict with the letter I received. At that time they told me that there were 2-3 payments that needed to be reviewed to determine \" officially '' what my date for PSLF would be. They stated this would take a couple of months. After two months, they said it would take four months, then six months, and so on and so forth. I called countless times to find out what the determination of the review was and it was not until XX/XX/XXXX ( a year and a half later ) that I received correspondence from them giving me what their new projected date for PSLF would be ( this document is also attached ).

At this time I spoke with a representative ( XX/XX/XXXX ) who told me that there was still a payment that was in dispute ( XXXX of XXXX ) because they said that the payment that I made was outside of my employment dates.

The representative told me that if I overpay or end up paying too long because they haven't resolved the payment review, that they will give me my money back. This is laughable to me that they expect me to trust that they will return money to me when they can not even keep track of the payments that I have given them up to this point.

At that time I consolidated my loans and moved my loans over to XXXX XXXX. All of my loans are in the correct categories now, however, a larger portion on my loans will take another 120 qualifying payments for qualify. This is disappointing.

I was in the process of trying to enroll in IBR and instead directed into forbearance as a better option. I recently looked at my records and there are multiple charges of interest capitalization totaling over {$65000.00} between XXXX and XXXX. At the time I was in XXXX   and thought that it was just the interest from XXXX school  capitalizing, but looking back at the account now, something is suspicious and I see at least {$65000.00} of interest that capitalized between XXXX that doesn't make sense on their paperwork and seems excessive. There is {$28000.00} of interest that capitalized in XX/XX/XXXX when my grace period from XXXX school  ended which makes no sense since the interest was already capitalized on earlier statements and I was not even in forbearance. It happened again when I was in forbearance but again, I was not told that the interest would capitalize when in forbearance, just that it would accrue. \n\nAlso, I have made payments in the past year to completely wipe out certain loans and then the next month there was nearly {$1000.00} back on the account. When I try to resolve with the company they always have an explanation, but not one that really makes good sense. \n\nI just thought I had overlooked something, but now I have heard that they are making errors like this and have been looking into my account and find it almost impossible use their system to understand my loan balances and how the balances are being calculated. I feel very uncomfortable, similar to when I had a property manager who turned out to be stealing from me by using a rigged spreadsheet to calculate my revenue. \n\nI have a significant amount of student loan debt from XXXX  school ( {$260000.00} borrowed initially ) however over {$200000.00} in interest has accrued since I have been in XXXX. It just doesn't make sense that {$65000.00} worth of interest could accrue within the first two years and then be capitalized without me being told this would happen. If this is an error the interest that has been charged on these amount will need to be recalculated as well because I should not have to may interest on principle that was improperly capitalized interest. \n\nThe amounts they report that I have paid in total so far also continues to fluctuate and seems to be wildly inaccurate on some of their spreadsheets and account statements.

I did this early to ensure that there were no issues as I am working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I have been on repayment plans in the past, have always had my documentation in early, and have always made my payments on time or early. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I made my first payment on my IBR plan of {$260.00}. XXXX. Then, one month later, my account balance was suddenly {$760.00}. XXXX. I emailed them on roughly XX/XX/XXXX, two weeks prior to the due date asking what was going on. I waited two weeks and never received a response. \n\nWhen I called them roughly around XX/XX/XXXX to clarify, they told me that I had a second IBR application for my graduate loans that needed income verification. Despite having income verification already on record, I immediately submitted additional income verification and asked for them to process it on the phone. They refused, claiming that I had to wait 20 days for it to be processed. After sitting on the phone for an hour waiting to speak to a supervisor, I had to leave. I was informed I could not leave the supervisor a message and would not receive a call back from a supervisor because my situation \" wasn't serious enough. '' At no point prior to this was it made clear to me that there were two separate IBR applications going. I was approved on XX/XX/XXXX for IBR payments and my understanding was that I was completely finished with the process. It does not make sense that I would only want IBR for my undergraduate loans, which are half the cost of the graduate loans. I never filed two separate applications so I do not understand how my one application and proof of income that should have covered all of my loans was split into two separate applications or why I had to submit an additional proof of income to get the second processed when one was already on file with them. \n\nDuring this call, I explained that I could not afford that payment and was angry that this was even the situation. The customer service representative suggested a forbearance until the application was processed. I was not happy that this would be on my credit when I had done my part in supplying the application for IBR and the related income verification back in XXXX. However, I saw no choice and did the forbearance. My understanding of forbearance was that it was the same as a deferment and my income would be verified and I could resume making IBR payments with the {$500.00} removed from my account. I even made the {$260.00} payment for my already established IBR application so that I would not have to miss a month towards PSLF. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received verification that I was now on an income-based repayment plan of {$280.00}. I saw that the {$500.00} was still on my account and assumed they were in the process of removing it. When I went to make my payment, I was told that if it went on the {$500.00}, I would have to pay the full {$500.00}. My understanding was that as part of forbearance, I would be required to pay the full amount if I paid any amount on the forbearance. It was at no point clearly explained to me what forbearance meant or that I was still responsible for this {$500.00}. I even called back because I could not cancel the payment as it already went through and I requested that they put that payment on the next IBR payment instead as that was the amount I paid. My understanding upon talking to them was I was still under forbearance for the month of XXXX so I asked them to apply the payment to the month of XXXX. The woman I spoke to told me she would do this, but she did not do this. So, with the understanding that my payment for XXXX was under forbearance and my payment for XXXX was covered, I did not make an additional payment in XXXX. \n\nThen I received a phone call stating on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX that I had a message on my account and when I checked this my account says I owe {$780.00} and am 47 days behind on a payment and threatened me with collections. I immediately paid the {$500.00} that was supposed to go to car repairs to avoid having my credit destroyed and am now reporting this to you. \n\nI do not understand why this has happened. I applied for IBR back in XXXX and provided income documentation that should have been good for a full year. At no point in all the times I have spoken to FedLoan Servicing and reached out to their staff was anything explained to me in detail. Now my account is a mess, my credit is damaged, and I have made a total of {$1300.00} worth of payments -- none of which I can apply to PSLF. I now have to start my PSLF process from scratch and will be required to make an additional 4 months worth of payments in my life time which will add up to far more that {$1300.00} when all is said and done.</td><td>List(applic, incom, base, repay, associ, document, regard, incom, earli, ensur, work, toward, public, servic, loan, forgiv, repay, past, alway, document, earli, alway, made, time, earli, made, first, payment, plan, month, later, account, balanc, sudden, rough, prior, date, go, never, receiv, respons, rough, around, clarifi, told, second, applic, graduat, incom, verif, despit, incom, verif, alreadi, record, immedi, addit, incom, verif, process, phone, wait, day, sit, phone, hour, wait, speak, supervisor, leav, inform, could, leav, supervisor, messag, would, receiv, call, back, supervisor, situat, wasnt, serious, enough, point, prior, made, clear, separ, go, understand, complet, finish, process, make, sens, would, want, undergradu, half, cost, graduat, never, separ, understand, applic, proof, incom, cover, split, separ, submit, addit, proof, incom, second, alreadi, file, call, could, afford, payment, angri, even, situat, custom, servic, repres, forbear, applic, happi, would, credit, done, part, applic, relat, incom, verif, back, howev, choic, forbear, understand, forbear, defer, incom, would, could, resum, make, remov, account, even, made, payment, alreadi, establish, applic, would, miss, month, toward, receiv, verif, repay, plan, still, account, assum, process, remov, went, make, payment, told, went, would, full, understand, part, forbear, would, full, amount, amount, forbear, point, clear, forbear, meant, still, respons, even, back, could, cancel, payment, alreadi, went, payment, next, payment, instead, amount, understand, upon, talk, still, forbear, month, appli, payment, month, woman, spoke, told, would, understand, payment, forbear, payment, cover, make, addit, payment, receiv, phone, call, messag, account, check, account, day, behind, payment, immedi, suppos, avoid, credit, understand, appli, back, provid, incom, document, good, full, year, point, time, spoken, staff, anyth, detail, account, mess, credit, made, total, worth, none, appli, start, process, scratch, make, addit, worth, life, time, said, done)</td></tr><tr><td>On XX/XX/2019 I called XXXX XXXX twice - but talked to three different individuals. The first call was with a very nice agent, but she asked me many questions ( most of which I did not know the answers ) and she told me to guess on the answers. Well, it was not clear to me why she was asking me the questions and that it would impact the monthly payment amount. She put me on hold many times when I told her the amount that she stated would not work for my family situation ( my husband has been unemployed for 4 years and has been in the process of applying for XXXX ). What I now know only because I did my research online is that she was trying to figure out how to reduce the payment through some of their various programs. She told me at one point that I had reached the maximum forbearance time which I thought was interesting as that had never been communicated to me in any previous communication with them ( a time limit was never provided ). Once I spoke with my husband and got the correct amounts for the financial questions they were asking I called back. This individual gave me a lower monthly payment, but it was still not doable. I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor ... the person was very hesitant and I told her that I was concerned that I was not being presented with any detailed information. She put me on hold and said she thought she could help me with some options. All of a sudden I had a different person on the line - she told me her name, but not her title. I assumed she was a supervisor, but she didn't have any different knowledge, but just spoke more eloquently ... .in fact, the number the previous person had provided she said was far to low than what they ever approve and so she raised it back up.

They even have the recording of the rep confirming that X amount is going towards student loan and X amount is going towards the service fee. In other words, the partial X amount of money that I was promised that would be going towards my loan is not reflected on my total loan at all, instead they placed me in delinquent status. Consequently, due to the fraudulent and shady tricks of Equitable and XXXX XXXX, my credit is at risk, my hard earned money is gone and interest on my student loan amount is accruing every day. The rep at Equitable is not willing to cancel the service or refund the amount even after explaining the whole thing to them. Instead he is telling me that contract was made and it was signed by the consumer, therefore I have to pay the full service fee. On top of that, my loan amount -- - they have nothing to do with it. This new rep clearly mentioned that they DO NOT help in repayment of loan, then why was the previous representative saying otherwise? ( the call recording confirms that previous rep will be deducting X amount of money to go towards loan as a part of the service fee ). Also, the contract was electronically signed by the Rep over at XXXX and equitable acceptance, I did not sign it physically.

The loans were then consolidated in XXXX to include graduate student loans. The service provider was switched to XXXX XXXX, and subsequently Navient acquired the loans around XXXX. From XXXX I made several lump sum overpayments. Navient did not allow me to direct these overpayments to the loan of choice, rather they applied them evenly across the two private loans and two federal loans. \nTrying to understand the complete loan payment history, and reason why the amount owed in XX/XX/XXXX was more than the original amounts borrowed ( despite overpayments ), I requested via phone, a complete history of payments made on the loans. I was told by the customer service representative that this was not possible since Navient did not service my loans prior to XXXX. I asked for an accounting of the amount that was acquired by Navient in XXXX and a complete accounting from that date. I was told by the customer service rep that I would receive the accounting via mail within 2 weeks. Subsequently, the accounting was never received via mail or electronic mail. \nI was also told by the customer service represenative that when Navient acquired my loans they were in a \" repayment plan of forbearance ''. I explained to the customer service rep that \" forbearance '' is a loan status and not a \" repayment plan ''. I was trying to understand why the repayment plan I had selected with my prior provider ( 15 years graduated repayment ), did not carry with the loan acquisition by Navient. This information has still not been provided. Rather I was told repeatedly by the customer service representative that the \" repayment plan was forbearance ''. \nI have since re-finance my loan with a private servicer since Navient could never provide a clear accounting or transparency into how my payments were applied. \nSuccessful resolution of this issue would be a complete accounting of how all payments were applied by Navient.

Beginning in XXXX, repayment began on the loans. I was unable to pay the amount and had to renegotiate payment plans on several occasions. Fast forward to the last few years when I became more financially stable. I have been paying several hundred dollars each month, which has gone only to interest. The interest rate has been hiked up over and over, and is now sitting at 12 % on the loans. I have created spreadsheets detailing all payments, including principal and interest.

After going over the information on the phone, they lady at NelNet said that my payment would continue to be {$0.00} ( this made sense because my wife has student loans through XXXX and her payment was also continuing to be {$0.00} and we both had to re-verify at the same time of year ) I was sent paperwork in the mail to sign and return, which I did. I did not receive any further communication from Nelnet. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I applied for an auto loan.

These 14 loans had been reported as never being paid since XX/XX/XXXX but only once they had become 90 days or more past due. I had no idea I owed anything. Since my wife and my income are the same and we both filed the same paperwork, why would one servicer charge a payment and the other servicer not charge a payment? \nNelnet refused to even consider that they had made a mistake.

The second rep offered me the graduated repayment plan, if I paid a {$5.00} exit fee, and put my loan into forebearance. I asked about the interest during that time, and she said XXXX would accrue. I then asked if there was a different option, and why is it that I would have to pay {$5.00} to exit, plus the interest. She then told me I could straight up pay XXXX to exit the plan. I do not have an extra {$2000.00}. I ended up paying the XXXX, and told her I would pay the XXXX during the forebearance. I had also just paid toward my monthly payment, and she told me that XXXX would go toward the interest during forebearance.

I agreed to the terms and politely thanked the representative. About 2 weeks later my co-signer called me in regards to harassing phone calls happening multiple times a day in the mornings at about XXXX straight through the evening until XXXX. These calls state that I am past due on my payment etc. \n\nI explained to my co-signer that I spoke to someone and was able to place a deferment/forbearance on the account.

She said they didn't know what they were doing and that this was not something they could provide me for my private loan. \n\nI then was placed on several holds where she informed me that there was nothing they could do to help my financial situation and when I stated then I was going to unfortunately default on my loan unless they can get my payment down to about {$150.00} a month. She then placed me on another hold and came back and said, \" ok what I am going to do is set you up on a payment for 6 months of {$150.00}.

When I asked how it was denied because they already took my payment she placed me on a hold to speak to her manager.

During these 13 years, I was in an extended graduated repayment plan ( 25 year term ) and I paid $ XXXX/month. \n\nIn XXXX, unbeknownst to me, my loan was transferred to XXXX. Because XXXX had my wrong address on file, I did not find out about the transfer until they emailed me in early XXXX. Fortunately, I had my monthly student loan payment on autopay to XXXX XXXX and it appears ( though I can't know for sure ) they forwarded the payments on to Nelnet until the time I became aware of the transfer. \n\nWhen Nelnet first sent me a monthly statement, the payment amount requested was over {$500.00}. The payment plan on my account was \" graduated '' rather than \" extended graduated, '' which meant a 10-year loan term rather than a 25-year loan term. \n\nI called Nelnet in XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the payment plan. I spoke with a nice woman named XXXX who attempted to determine why my payment plan was changed. She offered an income based repayment plan and I advised her that I would not qualify for an IBR, IDR or any other type of income-contingent program and that I just wanted to go back to the extended graduated plan I was previously on. ( I also gave her the address I have been at for the past 3 years so she could correct it in her system ) At first, XXXX said she could not put me in an extended graduated plan as I was not \" eligible. '' When I explained to her that I certainly was eligible as I was on this plan previously with XXXX XXXX ( and that I was a consumer XXXX who has XXXX a lot of student loan issues ) she went back to her managers who then approved my entering the extended graduated plan with a monthly payment of {$300.00}. I received a letter from Nelnet reflecting this change. \n\nThen, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX from Nelnet called me to tell me that her system showed her that I was ineligible for the payment plan that she thought she previously put me into and that my monthly payment would be {$540.00}. I advised XXXX that I thought we had already resolved this matter and she agreed. She tried to put me in the extended graduated plan again and said she was not able to. I told her that I was going to file a complaint with the cfpb as this type of mistake in servicing transfer was unacceptable. At that time, she asked if I wanted to speak with a manager and I said yes. \n\nNelnet manager XXXX then came on the phone and I explained the situation to him as well. XXXX said that it looked like there was a \" hiccup '' in Nelnet 's system causing the problem.

I verified from the first customer service rep, that I was doing everything correctly, and they would then transfer me to someone who could set up automatic payments over the phone.

I was then transferred back to a student loan customer service rep. This is now the 4th customer service rep I have spoken to. Again, I explained the situation. They apologized profusely as I was told they can not set up automatic payments over the phone and apologized that I'm not able to online. \n\nConsequently, I was told by the 4th customer service rep that I must manually fill out a form, that they would email to me, and fax it or take the form into a Wells Fargo branch and they would then fax it. I was told I can not email it back. \n\nIt is XXXX and I am in my XXXX 's. I have never used fax, nor do I have readily available access to a fax. I'm not even sure where I could find one.

My parents had a college fund for me, but my sister unexpectedly passed away 9 months before I was to leave for college. My college fund went to her funeral costs. After college I did not get a decent paying job until approximately XXXX, although I was expected to pay a huge percentage of my monthly income to NJ CLASS and I could not keep up, I also had my first son in XXXX and communicated numerous times to HESAA that I need to go into economic hardship deferment while on maternity leave. This was not passed along to whoever it needed to be, and despite days upon days on hold for hours with NJClass and a newborn, I never got a person to talk to. They immediately put my loans into default despite my requests for economic hardship deferment. My loans were removed from the website and I had no way of paying anything. My mom ( cosigner ) was also paying interest until she could no longer afford it given a job change and divorce. Shortly after ( XXXX ) they took me to superior court, I prepared all of my correspondence with them and went to court, NJ Class attorney did not show, I never received a rescheduled court notice, until I was served with a notice that they obtained a judgement on me at a court date I was not notified of, and they put a lien on my mothers house. I am a single mom to XXXX children, and I do my best to pay all my bills, I am not late or in default on anything else, even my federal loans are consolidated and, in an income-based repayment plan. These loans are ruining my credit no matter how hard I try to pay everything, they either want me to pay the entire balance plus attorneys fees or nothing. They have garnished my moms and my state tax return every year since about XXXX, yet the balance keeps increasing exponentially. I want to take care of this and get this behind me I have finally gotten a good job and want to make payments, but I want to make sure they are being tracked and my account is current and then I need options for refinance and consolidation. I also do not believe I am responsible for attorney fees since their mess up caused this issue in the first place if they put it in deferment when I qualified for it and asked repeatedly and worked with me on the payments none of this would have happened. I am a responsible person, but the loans are not live on the website I had no way of paying them without saying I was responsible for lawyer fees.

Please apply payments as follows : 1. After applying the minimum amount due for each loan, any additional amount should be applied to the loan that is accruing the highest interest rate. 2. If there are multiple loans with the same interest rate, please apply the additional amount to the loan with the lowest outstanding principal balance. 3. If any additional amount above the minimum amount due ends up paying off an individual loan, please then apply any remaining part of my payment to the loan with the next highest interest rate. It is possible that I may find an option to refinance my loans to a lower rate with another lender. If this lender or any third party makes payments to my account on my behalf, you should use the instructions outlined above. Retain these instructions. Please apply these instructions to all future overpayments. Please confirm that these payments will be processed as specified or please provide an explanation as to why you are unable to follow these instructions. Thank you for your cooperation.

I have had to contact them numerous times to correct this issue and to close out the paid in full account to stop this but have yet to resolve the issue. The paid off account is still open and Navient still deducts the monthly payment of {$87.00} and holds it while charging interest on the other loan instead of applying the payment to the final loan.

I have been on Social Security XXXX and have had extraordinary medical expenses and loss of income due to health issues. \n\nThe payment plan I was on was discontinued because of a technicality because I did not call Navient to continue the repayment program so the lower interest / lower payment program was discontinued and the payment went from $ XXXX month to $ XXXXmonth. Additionally, all of the interest during the term of that program was set at 1.5 % but when the program was discontinued, the typical interest rate of 12 % was recapitalized back into the loan inflating the balance of the loan. \n\nI have repeatedly told Navient that I can not afford {$1700.00} /month payment but they will not change the payment plan and tell me they will continue to advance the loans to default. \n\nThe original principle balance of these private student is a fraction of the current principle / recapitalization interest balance. \n\nI am recovering my health and Navient offered and setup a repayment plan that would lower the monthly rate to an affordable rate of 1.5 % but after setting up the repayment program and payment plan, Navient said a few days later that the program was not actually approved and they wanted additional private family information. \n\nI am willing to pay these student loans under the 1.5 % interest rate and payment of $ XXXXmonth that was offered and actually setup in their system but the Navient manager said it was discretionary whether they approved anyone for this repayment program. This sounds like a practice of disparate treatment ... the program is available but Navient evidently wants to maximize their $ income ... without regard for individual privacy. \n\nDuring one of my earlier discussions with a lower level Navient representatives he said that Navient was just one big credit card company that would do anything to collect payments and increase corporate funding. \n\nLastly, the representative confided to me that Navient has been actively selling loans to 3rd party collection agencies ever since the CFPB and other State Attorneys offices filed lawsuits against their predatory loan and serving practices.</td><td>List(repay, privat, student, social, secur, extraordinari, medic, loss, incom, health, payment, plan, technic, call, continu, repay, program, lower, interest, lower, payment, program, payment, went, month, addit, interest, term, program, program, typic, interest, rate, back, loan, balanc, loan, repeat, told, afford, month, payment, chang, payment, plan, tell, continu, advanc, default, origin, principl, balanc, privat, student, fraction, current, principl, recapit, interest, balanc, health, setup, repay, plan, would, lower, month, rate, afford, rate, set, repay, program, payment, plan, said, day, later, program, actual, addit, privat, famili, inform, will, student, interest, rate, payment, actual, setup, system, manag, said, discretionari, whether, anyon, repay, program, like, practic, dispar, treatment, program, avail, evid, maxim, incom, without, regard, individu, privaci, lower, level, said, credit, card, compani, would, anyth, collect, increas, corpor, last, repres, activ, sell, parti, collect, ever, sinc, state, predatori, loan, serv)</td></tr><tr><td>XXXX has taken over the loan management after I enrolled in the PSLF program.

I sent in the renewal, and they MORE THAN DOUBLED MY PAYMENTS! I can't afford such a large increase in payments, even more strange it doesn't pass their own criteria for setting the payments.

They should look at the paycheck instead, and base the payment only on the guaranteed income without the overtime, which comes and goes and is voluntary. So for example last year my guaranteed income was {$76000.00} but my tax return shows an income of around {$120000.00} so that is quite a difference.

Her answer was \" you must have paid only principle not interest '' I advised her and offered to walk her through my screens, their system does not allow you to pay only principle, furthermore the payment history screen shows that I did pay the interest that is reappearing in error.

There has been an obvious miscalculation of Public Service Loan Forgiveness payments, counting only 9, as I have been making full monthly payments through and income-driven repayment plan faithfully since XXXX when I first consolidated my loans for the express purpose of being in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I just recently sent updated employment certification forms - again - from eligible employers with eligible employment XXXX, detailing no new information I have not sent multiple times since XXXX. I received a reply back that the forms were received and no updates were to be made, and they detailed my eligible employment dates erroneously in spite of having clear, concise data on the proper forms that indicate a continuous period of eligible employment. \n\nI have always submitted all paperwork on time every time it was asked of me, and I have never had to stop making eligible monthly payments because of financial trouble. Twice in the last few years I have had my account put in forbearance because of their clerical errors - already detailed documented in a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint I have placed in XX/XX/XXXX - that contribute to a significant extension of my loan by no fault of my own. \n\nThe incentive structure is extremely problematic here. Through income-driven repayment >90 % of my payment goes to interest, with the last small fraction going to a very large loan, so they are obviously incentivized to keep my loan going as long as possible.

I had to take time to call the toll free number, wait on hold to then be told that I had to print and fill out a request to put my loans back into repayment and then scan back to them. I completed this on the XXXX when I made the call and my loans are still listed in deferment. This is ridiculous and should not have happened without me making a request to defer my loans. I have copied the email that I received below. \n\n\nXXXX XXXX UNIVERSITY notified us that you're enrolled in school. We placed your loans on an In-School Deferment or updated your existing deferment dates. This means you are not required to make payments until your deferment ends.

The collection agency is called FHCann & Associates and this is the worst company I have EVER dealt with. The process to start paying my loans back took many, many, many phone calls while I was trying to work. They needed paperwork after paper work. I was having to fax them and that wasn't good enough so I had to email them and that still wasn't good enough. This went on and on to the point that it was absolutely ridiculous. We had settled for {$100.00} a month so I had direct deposit set up for them to take it out my account and they have every month without fail. They had tried to go up on my payments to {$150.00} and then they actually tried to go down on my payments to I think it was {$55.00}. I told them that we would keep it at {$100.00} and they agreed. I was also told that after I make 9 payments on time that my loan would come out of default status and I would be able to make my payments to the Department of Education instead of them. Finally I was told that the papers I had sent were good but they had already taken I think 2 payments and I thought we were all set. All of a sudden I get my statement in the mail and it looks different so I called them. They stated that even though I had been making payments every month on time through direct deposit that it was not qualifying payments and I would basically have to start all over again and they needed a new income statement and pay stubs. I am currently in the busiest time of the year so I have been pulling 60 plus hours every  week since the beginning of the year so when I send them my financial statement my payments will be outrageous and because I won't be able to afford those payments so then any payments I make would be non-qualifying payments therefore my loan would never come out of default.

Never once in four plus years did XXXX XXXX send me a letter, an email or a phone call to tell me this information even though they were processing my employment verification letters annually while ignoring my emails asking for verification. Further conversations with XXXX XXXX have yielded zero results and extremely poor customer service with them stating there is no way to appeal or rectify the fact that I was misled for four years about my repayment. Had XXXX XXXX   informed me in a timely manner then I could have years worth of qualifying payments towards PSLF and be close to applying for forgiveness.

I XXXX Tokens/Loan types. I am currently signed up on an extended level monthly plan of {$870.00}. The {$870.00} payment I make each month is more than the amount of interest that the accounts accrue and thus, should cover the principal accrued for each month, with some left to go to principal. \n\nIt was my belief that the {$870.00} would be applied among the XXXX tokens, with the amount first going to each token 's monthly accrued interest and any excess towards the principals. \n\nOn XX/XX/2019, I made my {$870.00} payment for the month of XX/XX/2019. However, when I reviewed how my payment was allocated on my online account, I saw that Great Lakes did not allocate it properly to Token XXXX. I owed at that point in time about {$22000.00} on Token XXXX. From XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019, I accrued {$130.00} of interest on Token XXXX. Yet, of my {$870.00} monthly payment, only {$18.00} went to Token XXXX. That left {$120.00} of unpaid interest on Token XXXX. Great Lakes reallocated the remaining {$850.00} towards the other XXXX tokens, and applied {$450.00} of it to Token XXXX, although that token had only accrued about {$220.00} in interest that month. \n\nI am very concerned that Great Lakes is not allocating my payment to cover all the monthly interest accrued on Token XXXX. As stated in the beginning, my monthly payment of {$870.00} is more than enough to cover the interest accrued monthly on all XXXX tokens. It is also my understanding that my monthly payment would cover the interest accrued monthly on all XXXX loans. I am confused and perplexed as to why Great Lakes would not apply my payment to cover the interest accrued for Token XXXX. I am concerned going forward, because if they are not applying my monthly payments are not going towards all the monthly interest accrued for Token XXXX, then that interest will accumulate and it will be harder to pay it down in the future. \n\nIt is my belief that Great Lakes intentionally misapplied my payment. On XX/XX/2019, I made a second monthly payment of {$5000.00}. The second {$5000.00} payment was suppose to go straight to the principal of XXXX XXXX. \nIt was my intent to pay {$870.00} as my monthly payment ; the {$870.00} would cover the monthly interest accrued for all XXXX tokens, including the {$130.00} of accrued interest on Token XXXX. Afterwards, I was going to make a second payment of {$5000.00} to that would fully go straight to the principal of Token XXXX. I was allowed to do that as long as I made my required payment of {$870.00}. \n\nInstead of applying my monthly payment of {$870.00} to all the interest accrued on the XXXX tokens and then applying the full {$5000.00} to the principal of Token XXXX, Great Lakes applied only {$18.00} of the {$870.00} to Token XXXX. \n\nIt then used {$120.00} of the {$5000.00} to pay the remaining monthly accrued interest of Token XXXX, and then the remaining {$4800.00} went to the principal of Token XXXX. \n\nI believe Great Lakes is doing this because it is intentionally trying to delay me from paying down my principal.</td><td>List(believ, great, intent, month, payment, current, extend, level, month, plan, payment, make, month, amount, interest, accru, thus, cover, princip, month, left, princip, belief, would, appli, among, amount, first, go, token, month, interest, excess, toward, made, payment, month, howev, payment, account, great, alloc, proper, token, point, time, token, interest, token, month, payment, went, token, left, unpaid, interest, token, great, toward, appli, token, although, token, interest, month, concern, great, payment, cover, month, interest, token, state, begin, month, payment, enough, cover, interest, month, also, understand, month, payment, would, cover, interest, month, confus, perplex, great, would, appli, payment, cover, interest, token, concern, go, forward, month, go, toward, month, interest, token, interest, accumul, harder, futur, belief, great, intent, payment, made, second, month, payment, second, payment, suppos, straight, princip, intent, month, payment, would, cover, month, interest, interest, token, afterward, go, make, second, payment, would, fulli, straight, princip, token, long, made, payment, instead, month, payment, interest, full, princip, token, great, appli, token, use, month, interest, token, went, princip, token, believ, great, intent, tri, delay, pay, princip)</td></tr><tr><td>I have reached out to the department of education regarding the student loans for XXXX XXXX XXXX college with no help.

This capitalized interest has been accruing without my knowledge and Nelnet has not notified me of the existence of this debt. \n\nWhen I asked the Nelnet rep how I was supposed to pay off this capitalized interest that I am not being billed for and which has now grown to be a debt of {$1400.00}, I was told to just add {$64.00} to my monthly payment of {$360.00} even though that does not appear anywhere on the monthly statement as a debt I owe. However, if I only pay $ XXXX/month, I will keep up with the monthly interest accumulating but never pay off the total debt, right? That seems like bad advice and disingenuous. How can I pay off a debt that I never get billed for and never get notified of its existence? \n\nI spoke with another Nelnet phone rep named XXXX back on XX/XX/XXXX, to inquire why the extra principle payment I sent in was not applied to my loan and instead was issued as a credit on the following months statement ( statement date : XX/XX/XXXX ). I was told that I accrued interest of {$110.00} during a previous forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that had not been paid off so extra payments could not be paid toward principle until that had been paid off. I asked how was I to know about this and how could I pay it off XXXX said she would investigate and I have still not heard back ; in the meantime, Nelnet is apparently charging me daily interest without billing me for it and without informing me of the debt. \n\nI made numerous payments toward extra principle in XX/XX/XXXX before Nelnet purchased my loan and they were applied per my instructions to pay down principle. When I paid extra to Nelnet, it was not applied to either the principle or the capitalized interest but instead was designated as a credit to the following month 's bill.

I filed bankruptcy in XXXX, listing this private loan and showed proof of unable to repay without it affecting my ability to live. at that time, I thought it was taken care of. \n\nFast forward to today, I have had numerous issues with Navient and this is not the first time I have had to file a CFPB complaint against them. They refuse to offer any forgiveness. They refuse to lower the interest rate and it has grown from XXXX to XXXX.

Well I filed Bankruptcy again, being careful to ensure that they were petitioned, and took all the necessary steps to include my student loans. They did not show up to the hearing and were well informed. The judge approved dismissal of all loans including student loans, and I was able to prove that It would be a financial hardship to pay this back. They have practiced predatory lending practices and the school I went to is no longer open. \n\nNavient refuses to discharge the debt or provide any financial relief. \nThe original amount of both loans that were turned into private loans without my knowledge or consent was as follows : Loan 1 : current balance {$23000.00} Loan 2 : current balance {$8000.00} I am unsure of what else to do.

The first representative offered no options so I asked to speak to a supervisor. After speaking to a male supervisor, he also offered minimal options and before the call was over he said to me that I should find gainful employment so that I could be able to pay back my student loans. As a consumer, that was totally unacceptable as he does not know my situation. Also, his tone was rude and he offered no real solution to ensure that my accounts remained in good standing. I have always paid my Navient loans and would consider myself a good borrower. After reviewing the Navient website, it offers Extended Repayment and Rate Modification/ Extended Repayment options for private loans but I was told i am not eligible for either. As the phone call continued and the more frustrated I became, I did state that I'm better off letting the account go into collections. According to the supervisor I spoke to, even though I stated I will still pay Navient what I can afford, the supervisor stated I would still go into collections then default. How am I able to go into default if I still would be making payments but I just am unable to pay the full amount? Navient does not offer any working solutions for a borrower like myself to effectively manage their student loans. Their company rather send you to collections and destroy your credit rather than to help you stay current. Currently, my Rate Reduction Program is extended until XX/XX/2019 but I want Navient to offer me a better long term solution to repaying my student loans such as the Extended Repayment for the life of the loan.

I chose this option because the cost of my rent, car and household bills took up most of my low income. My payment was around {$100.00} and I faithfully paid it every month. After 4 years my payment NEVER decreased. I was only covering interest, and was charged hundreds of dollars in capitalized interest each year. \nIt is clear that they were pushing students to choose this plan to make the company more money in interest. Why would navient include a payment plan that would never pay off your loan? Because it was more money in their pocket. \n\n-Once I realized what was happening with the income driven plans, I switched to a graduated plan and began throwing any extra money I had toward my loans. The website has an option to allocate where extra payments go. I chose to tackle the highest interest loan and was putting all my additional payments toward that. There is also a place on the website to tell navient to either push out your due date when extra payments are made, or keep billing you the monthly amount. I specifically checked off the box to have them continue billing me for my monthly amount. However, over the years I have had to call and complain because they ignore this request and advance my due date on some loans. \nI believe they advance the due date on some loans so they will be able to charge capitalized interest. \n\n\n-The most recent issue I had was when I decided to go back to school to get my masters. My company paid for me to take a class, and I did not opt for any financial aid. I did not request for ANYTHING about my XXXX loans to change. A month into taking this class, I got a letter from Navient saying that my loans had been put into deferment because I was a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I DID NOT REQUEST OR APPROVE THIS. I had to call Navient to request they take my loans out of deferment. A month later I was charged {$61.00} in capitalized interest, despite having paid {$600.00} extra payments every month for 6 months. During the phone call I was told that the {$61.00} was for the 15 days that my loans were in deferment. That 15 days was the time it took for them to send me a letter informing me of the deferment. I check the website weekly, and it never said I was in deferment anywhere online. \nI also found out during this phone call that they had again been moving my payment due date a month forward with each extra payment I made. Therefore, some of my loans were accruing the capitalized interest WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE even though I had specially checked off the do not advance my monthly payment on the website. The woman on the phone told me that their system did not have it checked off. \n\nI am extremely frustrated with this company, and I worry for those new graduates who might naively assume that their minimum payments are making a difference in their loans. Students are trusting this company to handle their payments correctly, and Navient continues to cheat us out of thousands of dollars. Their communication is unclear and inconsistent. I now fully read my entire statement every month and compare it to my online account to make sure the information is correct. It almost never is. Something needs to be done to give students a fair chance at loan repayment. \n\n\nThank you for your time, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NH</td><td>List(hello, incred, concern, handl, student, loan, current, share, sinc, graduat, graduat, repay, incom, driven, repay, plan, chose, option, cost, rent, household, took, incom, payment, around, faith, everi, month, payment, never, cover, interest, interest, year, clear, push, choos, plan, make, compani, money, interest, would, includ, payment, plan, would, never, loan, money, pocket, happen, incom, driven, switch, graduat, plan, throw, extra, money, toward, option, alloc, extra, chose, tackl, highest, interest, loan, addit, toward, also, place, tell, either, push, date, extra, made, keep, bill, month, amount, specif, check, continu, bill, month, amount, howev, call, complain, ignor, request, advanc, date, believ, advanc, date, abl, charg, interest, recent, issu, decid, back, school, compani, take, class, financi, request, anyth, chang, month, take, class, letter, say, defer, request, approv, call, request, take, defer, month, later, interest, despit, extra, everi, month, phone, call, told, day, defer, day, time, took, send, letter, defer, check, week, never, said, defer, anywher, also, found, phone, call, move, payment, date, month, forward, extra, payment, made, therefor, interest, without, knowledg, even, though, special, check, advanc, month, payment, woman, phone, told, system, check, extrem, compani, worri, might, naiv, assum, minimum, make, differ, trust, compani, handl, correct, cheat, communic, unclear, inconsist, fulli, read, entir, statement, everi, month, compar, account, make, sure, inform, correct, almost, never, someth, need, done, give, fair, chanc, loan, repay, thank, time)</td></tr><tr><td>I am currently receiving government assistance food benefits, health insurance, and cash benefits.

Two student loans are with Navient Corporation and are up to date. Nine are with the Department of Education and are in default status. More than three years ago my wife and I decided to consolidate our individual student loans. We both contacted Navient by phone and set up consolidation plans. All her loans were consolidated by Navient. Unknown to me, all eleven of my loans were not consolidated. Navient only took two of the loans, so the other nine sat at the Department of Education without my knowledge. I was under the impression from Navient that all eleven had been consolidated back in XXXX. \nWe filed our XXXX taxes in XX/XX/XXXX. We were to receive a refund. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from the IRS stating that they had seized, treasury offset, my tax refund because I had student loans in default. I immediately called the Department of Education and I was forwarded to their collection company, Consumer Research. I found out, by phone and online that nine of my student loans were in default since XXXX, with a principle balance of approximately {$44000.00}. Added onto the principle balance an {$8000.00} service fee by Consumer research. A total of around {$52000.00} was due. \nOver the last three years, I was under the impression that I was either paying monthly payments on my student loans or when employment was part time, Navient suggested that I either defer or do a forbearance due to economic hardship. The remaining student loans at the Department of Education sat for more than three years went into default and there was no attempt to communicate that information to me by mail, email, or phone by the Department of Education for the past three years. \nWhen I spoke to a representative from Consumer Research, I was certified and then told that I have three options to settle my defaulted student loans. None of which I could afford, so I have been currently working with a company called XXXX XXXX to attempt to get my student loans out of default. \nThe Navient Corporation is currently being sued by five plus states including Washington, who have alleged improper actions on behalf of student loan borrowers. I have recently contacted the Washington State Attorney Generals office and filed a complaint against Navient. \nFor Misallocated payments Steered me toward multiple forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans, and Provided unclear information about how to re-enroll in income-driven repayment plans Created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information Processed payment incorrectly Failed to act when I complained Harmed the credit of XXXX veterans, I am a XXXX XXXX veteran. \nThe Consumer Financial Protection Agency has alleged Navient has systematically and illegally failed borrowers at every stage of repayment. \nThank you for your time.

They begin to garnish my wages due to the default,15 % of disposable income was garnished per pay check. In XX/XX/XXXX I was aware that the loan would finally be paid off soon. I called XXXX and asked for the balance. I was advised that my loan was almost paid off, as I only owed {$290.00}, Since on average they were taking apprx. {$210.00} per check this meant I would be paid in full in apprx 1 mo, as she advised that was not the final payoff amount due to monthly interest charges. She stated to call back after my next paycheck to check the balance. I called 2 weeks later and was advised that I only owed apprx. {$80.00}. I inquired if {$80.00} would be the amount taken out and was advised I would have to call my HR department and advise them to adjust the amount. I contacted my HR department and was advised that they are required by law to take 15 % of my disposable income until they received notification that the loan was satisfied. I called XXXX back and was advised that a letter had been sent to my employer advising of the adjusted amount. The final deduction was made for apprx {$290.00}. I contact XXXX  and was advised that a refund check would be sent to me. I contacted my HR department who confirmed that they had not received notification to stop the garnishment and it would occur unless they receive a notice of release. I called XXXX back and had them fax a letter to my HR dept. I'm not sure why I would have to do this. At this point they had 2 weeks to notify my employer to stop the garnishment. After several weeks I receive a call from XXXX. I only know they called me due to having caller ID, no message was left no text message received. I was wondering why they would be calling me since I had received written correspondence confirming my loan was satisfied. I also saw that my loan was reported as Paid in Full to the credit reporting agencies and the garnishment had stopped for several paychecks. When I spoke to XXXX I was advised that was my case manager calling me to advise that I owe a balance of {$280.00}. I asked how since my loan was satisfied. He stated that a payment of {$210.00} was credited to my account 2x by accident. Once the accident was noticed the payment was reversed. I asked if a double payment of {$210.00} was credited why do I owe {$290.00}. He stated interest charges. I asked how could I be charged interest on a mistake that was not made by me nor was I notified of error. He stated finance charges were assessed and I had 30 days to pay the balance or my wages would be garnished. I asked to speak to member of management and was transferred to a voicemail with no name. I left a message and asked for call back which i never received. I called back to follow up on my request to speak to a manager and inquire why I received a letter from my HR department advising that my wages were being garnished for {$490.00}. The rep stated that a payment of {$210.00} was applied 2x by accident then reversed off the account and a refund check of {$170.00} was sent in error and finance charges. She stated that since my account was in default my finance charges are higher than normal. I asked again how can I be charged finance charges for mistakes not made by me. I asked why wasnt i informed of any of this. I at this point I had received 1 phone call with no message left, 0 letters, 0 emails and 0 text. She  stated that there was nothing that could be doon and if i dont pay in full the wage garnishment would occur. I asked for a manager and received the same nameless voicemail.

This will leave us with well over $ XXXX in forgiven loans. That seems great but Ive learned that the IRS considers forgiven loans as income and is taxed that way. Why would the government put us on a plan that seems like a great deal only to burden us in our XXXX with a insurmountable tax bill?

I had made an attempt to pay my student loan debt in XX/XX/XXXX but fell victim to an online scam and all of payments throughout the course of that year were never given to your company.

Again I have been monitoring my credit closely and making all attempts to the best of my capabilities to pay all debts with my available funds. \n\nPlease Note : Because of my separation and then divorce i could not file my taxes for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX due to the fact that i was employed by my ex-husband as an independent XXXX at his Tattoo Studio ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) throughout the course of the marriage.

In XX/XX/XXXX I offered to settle the loan with {$20000.00} that I was able to save while on XXXX in the XXXX but was told that they do not settle for less than the full amount. Since then I have still been affiliated with the XXXX as a XXXX while working as an XXXX XXXX up until XX/XX/XXXX before I XXXX again, while still working on my XXXX which I just completed on XX/XX/XXXX. In early XX/XX/XXXX although I was working, I really struggled to make my monthly payments. I was threatened with my loan being reported as defaulted and losing my vehicle and being sued. I have never resisted repaying the loan due to negligence, I simply just cant pay an amount that I do not have. Only after 3 months of phone calls, did they finally offer me a reasonable repayment plan but only temporarily and after months of damaging credit which has hindered my ability to refinance with anyone else because of the delinquent history. Even while under the interest rate reduction program with automatic payments from my checking account, I have encountered issues with them not withdrawing the money. Specifically, in one instance after hurricane Irma and Maria, I called to inquire as to why they did not debit my account for the agreed monthly payment? I was told that the payment was waived because of a natural disaster declaration, but the next month when I called because I noticed the date had passed from when they would have charged my account, nothing was pulled. This time when I called, I was told that I had violated the terms of the program and had to pay a provide information to be accepted into another program which required a higher monthly payment. As a current XXXX, I am trying to find better employment to be able to meet my obligations, but currently I can not support what they are asking monthly for {$56000.00} loan gown 4 times the original amount with a 15.375 % interest rate. The school that I obtained the loan counseling through doesn't even exist anymore so there is no one available to challenge about the information they explained to me and now there is a different institution listed as the school where the original loan was acquired. I very seriously doubt that they have any interest in making things simpler for me, really just want to make more money on a smaller loan principle 15 years old.

I get a call today that says I'm behind, but I'm curious why since I see the money pulled every month. Apparently the last person I talked to set up my payment schedule to the wrong amount so I was underpaying each month, which made me delinquent. I'm done dealing with these people.

About once every other month I have to call to inquire about why the minimum payment has been allocated in a way that is inconsistent or incorrect. Each time I call I am told it will be fixed and they are not sure why it was allocated in this way. These misallocations result in a higher percentage of my payment going towards interest and allows the interest to accumulate ultimately making my final payment further away and costing me more money. Today I spoke to a representative who told me that the way I see my account ledgers online is not consistent with the way she sees the same on her end. She also conveyed that \" the system '' was allocating money towards loans I have already paid in full ( one a full year ago and another three full years ago ). She could not explain how or why either of these things were occurring but told me she would \" submit a ticket '' and that the problem should \" probably be resolved within two weeks ''.

XX/XX/XXXX my loans we're handed over to navient which is where they are being serviced now. I reached out several times about the federal loan forgiveness program in which I was advised I would be eligible for however after making payments all of which we're on time from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I was just made aware that I am not eligible by Navient. I received and continue to receive incorrect or inaccurate information from Navient which is now leading me away from being eligible for the student loan forgiveness program I was trying to be part of. I have tried to call the federal student loan forgiveness program to see if there is anything I can do however when I consolidated my loans apparently I needed to do so under a different loan category called direct loan. I was obviously never made aware of this when I made the decision and was never made aware of this even after I made this decision. Only now, did Navient make me aware however they also said that my 120 payments that I made which would qualify me for the forgiveness program would be reset if I re-consolidated to direct loans. I feel so disappointed that the company hired to service my loans and act on behalf of my best interest is not and did not do so when the timing was so crucial. Unfortunately, there is no company or department out there that is able to hold companies like this accountable for their lack of knowledge or for providing customers with incorrect information.

Most of the money I pay goes to the high interest rates which are non-negotiable ( or so it seems that way ).

The loan was only reduced because I had to dropout of school since I couldn't afford it. Sallie Mae sold the loan to Navient on XX/XX/XXXX for {$9500.00} and I've gotten it down to {$5600.00} since then. What I have paid in the lifetime of this loan so far is {$16000.00} ( Not the exact amount ) which comes out to the lender gaining about {$5000.00} on interest alone. The total amount of what I have paid so far is worth more than what the total original amount was that I was being charged and even the amount when it was sold to Navient. I have tried several attempts every year to call Navient and get a lower interest rate so I could actually make a dent in the loan amount but the answer I always get is that they can't do anything for me because it's a private loan. The only thing they can do is put me into default which will allow me to financially recover for a bit but the interest would continue to accumulate. I've paid more than necessary every single month yet the interest keeps going up and no matter how much I beg to have them work with me, it doesn't change a thing.

I agreed to pay interest only on that loan. To date Ive paid approximately {$3400.00}.

The discovery was brought to my attention upon graduation. I went to the school and met with Dean of Students, Financial Director and Student Advisor. Together we went over my daughters ledger. That loan was supposedly authorized by me and I allegedly agreed to defer interest. That never occurred. During this same period she was given another personal XXXX Loan ( {$3000.00} ).

I think XXXX should absorb the cost of my education and interest as I am concerned that the degree is now useless. \n\n\nI am in frequent contact with my lender but have never been able to afford my payment as my loan debt is now over $ 200k ; with a 6.5 % interest rate, my interest accrues at about $ 1000k/month leaving me little chance to ever pay down the principle. With my XXXX education costing double what my XXXX and XXXX degrees COMBINED cost and now rendering it useless, I think XXXX is in breach of contract and that loan debt should be transferred to XXXX. Please see my below statement for my experience with XXXX University, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \n\n\nWhile I am a graduate of XXXX with an XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX increasingly negative reputation and press has rendered my degree worthless. In light of the recent campus closures ( I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX campus ), the integrity of my degree has been severely impacted and will no doubt, have a profound impact on my future employment opportunities at the XXXX level. \n\nFortunately, I earned my XXXX XXXX from an accredited state school program that has allowed me to find employment at the XXXX level. In the process of onboarding to this position, I was advised by my current HR department that my XXXX degree could not be verified so I was hired ( and paid ) at the XXXX XXXX level. They use the XXXX XXXX   Database for degree verification and XXXX is not listed, therefore, my XXXX degree is not recognized and has not been valuable or useful to me in that regard. \n\n\nWhen I enrolled in XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, I feel I was misled in how XXXX presented its credentials and academic rigor and felt extreme pressure to accept admissions immediately. I learned of XXXX program through an XXXX Board Member ( who was one of my graduate school professors ) who said he could \" get me in '' and wrote a letter of recommendation on my behalf. \nThroughout the admissions process, their recruiter led me to believe that there were admission standards and hurdles that I was clearing, and pressed me to make a decision swiftly. \n\n\nDuring the admissions process, I inquired about XXXX accreditation and was told they were in the process of renewing it and expressed confidence that it would be reinstated shortly. I don't believe XXXX ever accredited my program. I was rushed into making a decision and fast tracked to the financial aid department. At several points during my education, I expressed concerns to the department chair ( who was literally a different person every year as it appeared they could not retain faculty for more than a year ), I was told that the onus of responsibility fell on me to understand licensure requirements and I could not get an answer as to whether or not the program would be sufficient for licensure. At the time that I enrolled in XXXX in XXXX, it had a decent reputation, but it quickly became clear to me, as well as other faculty I was working with, that XXXX changing policies and standards were unsavory. After the negative press of XXXX, in which XXXX was targeted for predatory lending and admissions practices, I knew that I had become involved with an institution with a tainted reputation. I attempted to transfer but learned that my 3 years of coursework would not be accepted and was advised to quickly complete the program, which I did. \n\n\nI am furious about the amount of debt I have accrued with a degree that held little value then, but now has no value in light of XXXX 's recent campus closures. I can not see any legitimate hiring agency recognizing my advanced degree coming from XXXX ; I don't see how I will be able to work in the field at the XXXX level. \n\n\nI am an intelligent person and not easily taken advantage of, yet in hindsight, I feel embarrassed and angry that I find myself in this situation. I am in need of guidance and help to address my current concerns. I have over $ 100k in student loan debt from XXXX alone, double what I accrued from my XXXX and XXXX degrees combined. It was an incredibly expensive program that failed to deliver what was promised - an accredited program that would prepare me for licensure at the XXXX level. I am ashamed that my name is associated with this institution and will have to eliminate it from my resumes and curriculum vitae to spare my reputation that I have worked so hard to establish. It is completely unjust that XXXX can close and leave a wake of student and alumni victims feeling angry and helpless.

I started working with a loan officer last year and paid to have someone help me fix things on my credit. The loan officer told me that i needed to get my student loans in good standings because with them in default in wouldn't qualify for any home loan having a student loan in default. So back in XX/XX/2018 I contacted immediate credit recovery to see what i needed to do to get my student loans in good standings so that i could be eligible to get my home loan. They told me that i could do a rehabilitation loan and after 9 months of consecutive payments then the loans would not be considered in default any longer and it would be shown in good standings and then i would be able to get my home loan because it wouldnt be considered a student loans in default. So i setup and sent in the documentation that they required and then every month they would send me a reminder that said the {$5.00} will come out this day. So my sister has given me the 9 months to get that in good standings so that i would be eligible to have the house in my name. The loan officer has all the paperwork that i needed to get in order to close on the house. One of the required Documents was a document from immediate credit recovery showing the account numbers and the rehabilitation amount. Well i called immediate credit recovery and told them what i needed, the first person that i talked to told me that the rehabilitation was only on 2 of my loans and the other 6 were not eligible. So i said no that must be a mistake, there would be no reason i told the lady to rehab 2 of my loans while the other 6 were still in default. That would still block me from getting a home loan and make absolutely no sense for me to have done that and have waited 9 months. She agreed and then said well i would have to listen to the phone call to determine if i was mislead to believe that it was for all of my loans and not just 2 of them. After a couple days of calling back she had finally listened to the original phone call and said that she apologized that i was not made aware that the rehabilitation was only for the 2 loans, she said that this was a mistake and i should have been told 2 were going to be out of default but i still had 6 loans also serviced by them that were going to be considered negative. Every month the {$5.00} letter i received would say total amount due at the top and would have like {$64000.00}. The lady said im not sure how i can make this right all i can offer you is a consolidation of all your loans at this point. I feel like they mislead me from the beginning and that should have been offered in the beginning, or should have even mentioned that it was only for a couple of the loans. So now my sister is going to have to sell the home that i have lived in for 5 years so that she can buy herself a new home. I have all the approvals for the home loan and was supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX, but now having 6 student loans in default still i will not be able to get the home loan and will be put out of my home. So i tried to fill out the consolidation to see if there is any way that would help my situation after being mislead for 9 months, but they gave me the wrong amounts of the loans that i needed to consolidate and they gave me the wrong account numbers as well. So im not sure if in the beginning they included all the loans only to find out that 2 were eligible and just didnt tell me but the fact of the matter is they made a mistake either in the beggining or when i called 3 weeks ago for the account numbers of the loans, and then they realized that i had been told misleading incorrect information. In the end they can apologize and that still doesnt help me keep my home, someone needs to be held accountable and they should not be able to mislead anyone else into something that is not what was even asked for. They should not be able as a debt collector to not provide me with false or inaccurate information with no repercussions in the end. The lady from immediate credit that i spoke with said that she had reported the issue to whomever that may be, however that does not help me now.</td><td>List(financ, home, live, name, get, marri, need, home, name, work, loan, offic, last, year, someon, help, credit, loan, offic, told, student, good, default, wouldnt, qualifi, home, loan, student, loan, default, back, immedi, credit, recoveri, student, good, could, elig, home, loan, told, could, rehabilit, loan, consecut, would, consid, default, longer, would, shown, good, would, abl, home, loan, wouldnt, consid, student, default, setup, sent, document, everi, month, would, send, remind, said, come, sister, given, good, would, elig, hous, name, loan, offic, order, close, hous, document, immedi, credit, recoveri, show, account, rehabilit, amount, well, immedi, credit, recoveri, told, first, person, told, rehabilit, elig, said, must, mistak, would, reason, told, ladi, still, default, would, still, block, get, home, loan, make, absolut, sens, done, agre, said, well, would, listen, phone, call, determin, mislead, believ, coupl, day, call, back, final, origin, phone, call, said, made, awar, rehabilit, said, mistak, told, go, default, still, also, go, consid, negat, everi, month, letter, receiv, would, total, amount, would, like, ladi, said, sure, make, right, offer, consolid, point, feel, like, mislead, begin, begin, even, coupl, sister, go, sell, home, live, home, home, loan, suppos, close, student, default, still, abl, home, loan, home, tri, fill, consolid, would, help, situat, mislead, gave, wrong, consolid, gave, wrong, account, well, sure, begin, includ, find, elig, didnt, tell, fact, matter, made, mistak, either, account, told, mislead, incorrect, inform, apolog, still, doesnt, help, keep, home, someon, need, account, abl, mislead, anyon, els, someth, even, abl, debt, collector, provid, fals, inaccur, inform, ladi, immedi, credit, spoke, said, issu, whomev, howev, help)</td></tr><tr><td>This school was closed recently in 2018.

To get ahead of the curve, I did a large payment of {$3000.00}. Since then, I have been paying roughly {$300.00} every month, which is a little bit more than my monthly payment. \n\nDue to the first bulk payment, all of my loan group payment due dates were pushed up considerably. I kept paying since this doesn't stop interest from accruing. I always chose the \" account payment '' option rather than the \" pay by group '' option as I figured Nelnet would distribute the money in the most reasonable manner to pay off the loans across the various loan groups and their respective interest rates. \n\nMy last payment ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I noticed that suddenly my {$300.00} went completely to interest. I found this highly suspect and called the company. According to a representative, a Dept. of Education policy change in XXXX dictated that early payments would always go to the loan group with the highest interest rate if the \" account payment '' option was chosen. Therefore, until the pushed up due date from my original bulk payment was finally reached, all of my payments were only going to one loan group ( since roughly XX/XX/XXXX ). \n\nWhile this sounds nice on paper, I don't know if this actually would help me, and I may have in fact lost money due to the accruing interest on the other loan groups that Nelnet didn't even distribute ANY money to over this period. While they allegedly were following DOE policy, I was never informed of this policy change by email or on the Nelnet website. I would NOT have continued to choose the \" pay by account '' option had I known this is how my money would be distributed. \n\nI feel as though Nelnet ( or any student loan collection agency ) must be liable for notifying borrowers for any change in payment policies.

I received emails indicating that my loans were in a grace period after graduating. Therefore, I was shocked to discover a large debit from my checking account via my loan servicer. I reread the emails to be sure I hadn't misread the content, and I was able to confirm that they indeed stated that my loans were currently in a grace period. In order to have documentation of my contact with my loan servicer, I emailed my inquiry about the situation using my loan servicing account online and for weeks I did not get a response to my question. I called to follow up on the issue and was told that the email that was sent to me was not correct in stating that my loans were in a grace period. Only some of my loans were in a grace period, but others were not, which caused the large withdrawal from my checking account. The representative could not provide me with any information regarding why I had been sent incorrect information regarding the status of my loans. \n\nSince I am taking care of an elderly family member with XXXX in lieu of working, I am unable to afford my student loan payments at this time. I applied for an Economic Hardship Deferment, and provided documentation using the online file upload. I have not received any acknowledgement that my application for deferment was received or processed in three days it will be one month from the date I applied. I called again and was told that my application was received but it has not been processed, and that it could take up to 20 business days, but that the processing times have been beyond this time frame. I was told by the representative that the only option was to contact my bank to file for a stop payment, which cost {$30.00}. After having the bank put a stop payment on my account I received an email from XXXX   XXXX  indicating that they had processed another debit from my account. When I went to verify this with my bank I found that this was incorrect, because the stop payment prevented the debit from being processed. Yet another email which provided correct information from my servicer. I understand that I am not alone in my experiences with this company. My experience with the company related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has been terrible, with the  company losing my paperwork repeatedly. The conduct of this student loan servicer is unacceptable.</td><td>List(write, regard, extrem, disarray, student, loan, receiv, grace, period, graduat, therefor, discov, larg, debit, account, loan, reread, sure, misread, content, abl, confirm, inde, state, current, grace, period, order, document, contact, loan, inquiri, situat, loan, account, respons, question, follow, issu, told, sent, correct, grace, period, grace, period, larg, withdraw, account, repres, could, provid, inform, regard, sent, incorrect, inform, regard, status, sinc, take, care, elder, famili, member, lieu, work, unabl, afford, student, loan, time, appli, econom, hardship, defer, provid, document, file, receiv, applic, defer, receiv, three, day, month, date, appli, told, applic, receiv, could, take, busi, day, time, beyond, time, frame, told, repres, option, contact, bank, file, stop, payment, cost, bank, stop, payment, account, receiv, anoth, debit, account, went, verifi, bank, found, incorrect, stop, payment, debit, anoth, provid, correct, inform, understand, alon, compani, experi, compani, relat, public, servic, loan, forgiv, program, terribl, compani, lose, repeat, conduct, student, loan, unaccept)</td></tr><tr><td>Sallie Mae is the original lender ; Navient is the current one. I am reporting on both companies - namely to complaint about a systematic effort on their part to provide misleading and incomplete information about the multitudinous forbearances and deferments granted by these two lenders to the primary borrower on 2 loans where I am listed as the co-signer. Even when explicitly requested information about these deferments/forbearances in writing, including information about terms and timeframe, Sallie Mae and now Navient have both withheld this information or refused to comply with the requests. This meant for over 1 years I had little information about the types of forbearances that these two were providing and whether they had made any effort whatsoever to offer less expensive payment plans - ones that dont cause the loans to balloon in size during periods of reduced payments. These reduced payments did not make possible for the borrower to be able to request a co-signer release after over a year of on-time payments, but they netted both Sallie Mae and Navient a significant profit. Recently I have been in touch with agent XXXX XXXX at Navient was the most recent individual at Navient to provide false and incomplete information about these loans. 3 months ago she had notified me that Navient had provided the borrower - XXXX XXXX - with yet another reduced payment forebearance but would not disclose the terms. It seems that Navient is intent on ensuring that the borrower would never be able to be eligible for a co-signer release and thats shes eager to have me back take over payments : in short, they fail to provide the borrower with a payment plan that actually pay off the loan, but instead allows it to increase in size as her reduced payments dont even cover interest. XXXX did disclose that Navient continued to allow the borrower to make below-interest payments as she took out new loans. If the borrower had the capacity to borrow more, then she didnt need a forebearance, and the granting of these to the borrower over and over again is meant simply to boost its profits at my expense. 3 months XXXX ago did say only that the borrower was to make 3 payments and then her account would no longer be past due. However, several days after the 3rd scheduled payment, Navient sent me another past due notice demanding payment for her loan. In short, Navient had lied again. \n\nId like to know why Navient continues to lie to me and why they continue to push these pointless forebearances on the the borrower that simply balloon the loan when not only does Navient know that she had recklessly borrowed since she first nearly defaulted on these loans, but that the borrower has NEVER made a single regular payment on these 2 loans, one of which Im now paying. The borrower has shown Navient that the borrower doesnt use forebearances to get back on her feet and be able to make regular monthly payments. No. She uses them to cause me the co-signer to be on the hook for more, as Navient profits. I charge that Navient has been and continue to collude with the borrower irresponsibly to rake in profit when it knows full well from her payment history alone that she has absolutely no intention to use these forebearances to be able to make regular payments that qualify for co-signer release. \n\nI also filed multiple fraud complaints that she signed these loans in my name but neither Sallie Mae nor Navient accepted them. They simply dismissed them.

I had been paying my student loans on timely since XXXX, I had never missed a payment. I had not missed a payment because I had my student loan setup through XXXX as an automatic reoccurring payment. Sometime in XXXX I logged in through my AES account and saw that I could save an additional .25 % on my loan if I setup the automatic debit through AES. That XXXX I went ahead and tried setting up the automatic debit. As to not pay the loan twice in one month, I cancelled my reoccurring payments through XXXX. The payment was not accepted in XXXX. When I got the email alert I called and spoke with AES customer service. They told me to try again, that there must have been an error. I set this up again and tried again the following month. The same thing happened, some sort of error. Again I called AES and they told me the same thing, to try again, to make sure the account numbers were correct and to try for the next month. I specifically asked if I needed to make a payment, I also asked if there would be a penalty and both questions were answered with a no. Finally I believe in the third month we linked the accounts. Before the success, I spoke with AES on the phone about 4-5 times, every time I was assured that my account was in good standing. After the first automatic debit I logged into my AES account, and I noticed that instead of my rate dropping .25 %, it had increased by over 1 full percentage point. I was horrified. I called AES and they told me I was part of a benefit borrowers program for paying timely. I lost that benefit when I missed a payment. I told them my story, specifically asking them to listen to the recorded conversations I had with their agents. I have not missed a payment since. My husband and I exchanged an email after getting off the phone with AES telling each other that we were, as per the agent, in good standing with no penalties?

Last years XXXX income-based repayment amount was XXXX and based on my salary of {$65000.00}. This year, you have raised the supposedly income-based repayment up to {$710.00}? The increase seems excessive, as based on the 10 % of gross income formula the correct amount would be much closer to {$590.00}. \n\nYour company has deliberately withheld the necessary information for getting that recalculation done for MONTHS, ignored my letter to do so and ample information regarding my current income, and continued to overcharge me. I am including a new IBR request and a copy of a recent paycheck. You will IMMEDIATELY recalculate my IBR based on my actual income, as you have been asked to do multiple times over the last few months. \n\nI live in XXXX, which currently has one of the highest costs of living in the nation, and can not be expected to sit by quietly while you take more than your due. I have never missed a payment to anyone who has held my loans ( including XXXX XXXX, who dispersed my loans to debt collectors rather than obey the laws regarding IBR ), and except for a few brief deferments have been paying steadily since the year XXXX. I would like to know when I might reasonably expect loan forgiveness from Navient, as it is usually offered after 20-25 years. \n\nAnd, by law, you only have a right to only 15 % of my DISCRETIONARY income ( which amounts to approximately $ XXXXmonth after expenses ), and NOT 15 % or greater of my gross income, you will abide by the law, and immediately adjust the IBR amount down to the expected amount. I am happy to provide receipts as required to prove the amount of my discretionary income.\n\nKindly respond in writing, so that I may share your answer with all those I have Ccd on this letter.

The account was consolidated at a rate of 3 % and it stayed at this rate until XX/XX/XXXX. The rate has jumped from 3 % to 5.25 % by XX/XX/XXXX. I was not even aware of it since payments are withdrawn automatically. Navient took over from Sallimae few years ago. This practice is to ensure students never get out of student debt. Is there any law against constant increase in rate approximately every three months. Is there any cap on student loan rate? I feel these are corrupt practices to make students keep on paying interest and not get out from debt. We have been making payments regularly over these years without missing a payment and are being rewarded with increased rates. Is there any federal agency overseeing these practices.

Around that time i just so happened to get a call from a Nelnet representative, I explained my situation and he stated that he would set me up on a deferment plan and that I wouldn't have to pay anything for a year. We went over all my information, he advised me he filled out everything and that I would be receiving the application in the mail and all I had to do was sign it and send it back.

I remember receiving an email from Nelnet, just  a typical automated one that said something like \" if you ever need us we are here '' and it showcased their online services that i was unaware of. I registered and everything looked fine. It was stating that I didn't have to make a payment until XXXX of next year ( XXXX ). I didnt question i just thought maybe i misunderstood the representative. \nIn XXXX I had received another call from Nelnet, I explained that I really wast financially able to pay what they were asking and the representative stated, no worries. We can set you up on a income driven plan and you would pay a low monthly payment. The same thing happened as before, they filled out my information, sent me a application, I filled it out and returned it.

I began to email Nelnet, I  emailed the CEO ( XXXX XXXX ), Director, President ( XXXX XXXX ), Primary contact ( XXXX XXXX ), Chief Executive ( XXXX XXXX ), Secondary contacts and their communication team.

Per Navient, these loans are now no longer eligible for in-school deferment. They say that each of these loans have a stipulated maximum of 48 months of in-school deferment. I dont recall this being vocalized to me at the time of origination but that was a long time ago. These loans did not have a co-signor. \n\nWhat makes this story so egregious is that I also have newer loans through Navient that were from when I attended a XXXX XXXX program   at XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ) with the aim of attending XXXX school. \n\nPrior to attending the XXXX XXXX program, I called Navient and asked about the possibility of obtaining private loans after voicing that my goal was to attend XXXX school. I sought these loans because I did not qualify for federal loans for the post-baccalaureate program. I told Navient about my goal of attending XXXX school and that I needed to take the science prerequisites prior to applying to XXXX school. I also asked if these loans or my goal of attending XXXX school would be negatively impacted/influenced by the loans I already had with them. Navient said they could certainly help me out with the private education loans, but at no time did Navient ever tell me that my private education loans from XXXX University would start to become ineligible for in-school deferment half-way through XXXX school. \n\nFurther, I applied for these private loans through Navient for three consecutive years, XXXX, for this XXXX XXXX program. In every application, that was filled out by Navient with me on the phone, when I was asked what my educational aspirations were and reasons for the loan, I always told them that I needed these private education loans because I wanted to attend XXXX school  and these loans were for a XXXX XXXX   program. At no time did Navient ever tell me that my private education loans from XXXX University would start to become ineligible for in-school deferment half-way through XXXX school. If I had been told about this, I might have not attended the XXXX XXXX program and XXXX school. \n\nSo here I am ; attending XXXX school and out of the work force. I am now told I can no longer receive in-school deferment for these loans. I am stuck. Navient has asked me if I can get a job to which I replied : XXXX school students are not allowed to work. Further, I have no recent work experience needed to secure a job. I have an apartment lease that I may have to break now, with further financial penalties, because I may have to drop out of XXXX   school and somehow find a job. I feel tricked. I feel like I was setup to fail. \n\nAt the beginning of last week ( XX/XX/19 ) someone at Navient submitted, on my behalf, a special extension application for in-school deferment but that was denied by Navient at the end of last week. My school, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, has called Navient on my behalf and Navient said the same thing : that these loans are now no longer eligible for in-school deferment. When I stated everything that had transpired above about my asking Navient prior to attending the XXXX XXXXe program and if I could receive private loans for the program and if they saw a problem with me attending XXXX school ( to which Navient said there was no problem and that they could help ), Navient said the same thing again : that these loans are now no longer eligible for in-school deferment. \n\nThe funny thing is that if I had already graduated from XXXX school, and already in a residency program, I could potentially qualify to have my payments postponed. \n\nXXXX website does not say anything about how many months of in-school deferment are left for each loan. Nor is there anywhere on XXXX website where I can even read the full loan contract that would state this, not that I would even know to check about this because Ive never heard of this before. In fact, they must mail me, per company policy, the loan contracts via USPS.
