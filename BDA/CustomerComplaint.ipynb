I am one of the many who needs this to be corrected and as soon as I am able to I am going to take all of my money and burn the Rushcard into ashes. But in the meantime I still need my money and it has not been resolved. This is not how a business is run especially if involves money and banking. If this was just a technical issue then there are ways to get the money back. They could issue checks. They could issue money orders. But instead they ignore our emails, avoid our calls, lie to us on the media, and the contract says no arbitration allowed.

As with all things there will be times when issues arise and even in ones efforts to resolve them effectively and sufficiently, there will be failures ; however in the case of this technical revamp Rush has proven to be incompetent. \nIT implementation is not my area of expertise however in my opinion a little more strategic planning may have been in the best interest of the customer, as well as the company 's brand ; which is now being viewed as negative. I assume one would have created a few mock situations, running them completely through, as a proactive approach and a way to resolve root causes in a timely manner. \nPlease understand I have been a customer with Rush since it launched, give or take a year. Although the card is not the best of them currently in the market, I have prided myself on being involved in what appeared to be a company that believed in the underbanked and had the backing of XXXX XXXX, who outside of rush I respect. Rush vision was to provide financial power to those who are/were underbanked, have the desire to establish credit or rebuild credit, among other things. \nIn addition to this I have even recommended family and friends who really had no desire to have a Rush card get one, as this allowed us to transfer money from one card to another for XXXX versus using XXXX XXXX or XXXX = Financial power/flexibility. By the way this service is no longer working ; which means there is no need for them or even myself to stay with Rush. Understand, I am very loyal and despite me being able to use a normal bank I enjoy the transfer to transfer card feature and would much rather not jump ship. \nTo date the changes made within the customer service department and its procedures I have embraced ; however I am at wits end. With all due respect, I am a person that believes in empowering people from all walks of life, but considering one is in a financial bind due to rush, having a person with a language barrier answering questions with lack of knowledge is extremely frustrating. In my opinion despite ones background we all deserve equal opportunity however Rush has not provided their workers with the adequate tools to successfully address the current needs. \nInstead customer service places you on hold for over XXXX mins, then the phone lines disconnect. Please see below example A. of just one of my many calls to Rush, where I was on hold for a long time and then line disconnected. \nAlso to add assault to injury on my part, I either lost my wallet or it was stolen, needless to say, as normal immediately I contacted Rush by phone and email to freeze, or deactivate the card, and to no avail, due to the IT issues. \nBelow is a chain of events about this communication, and by the way the card is still active, and still in risk of someone using it unauthorized. \nAt this point, I do not know what to do because my direct deposit is being issued to this active, but lost card. I have since contacted my HR department who is trying to stop the transaction and issue a live check ; which puts me in further issues, as I will be out of state on payday and will not have any funds or ways to cash the check. My desire was to have the lost/stolen card cancelled and a new one expedited to me over night ; however in not being able to speak to anyone at Rush, this is not feasible again. \nAs you can see Rush team, what should have been a simple IT enhancement, has turned into a financial Amputation, for those of us who believe in you. I have had to use XXXX XXXX to secure funds for my rent, I have had to pay things online with a card I do not have with the hopes whoever finds it does n't use it.

Today I called and was told that the system is yet again down and my account has went from {$500.00} to {$0.00} XXXX times today. On the occurrences that I seen money available I went to the ATM and get invalid responses and is told to contact my financial institution. I call them and they have NO answers of the time frame, its been 2 weeks. All they ask for is your number so that they can send you a text when the system is fixed. When I asked to speak to a manager I was put on hold and never returned to. The HARDSHIP this has caused for me and so many lower class citizens in America is unfair and should be unjust. There has to be some why this can be avoided in the future. Currently I am at home with {$10.00} in my pocket that I can not spend because it is my last.

I am one of the many who needs this to be corrected and as soon as I am able to I am going to take all of my money and burn the Rushcard into ashes. But in the meantime I still need my money and it has not been resolved. This is not how a business is run especially if involves money and banking.

As with all things there will be times when issues arise and even in ones efforts to resolve them effectively and sufficiently, there will be failures ; however in the case of this technical revamp Rush has proven to be incompetent. \nIT implementation is not my area of expertise however in my opinion a little more strategic planning may have been in the best interest of the customer, as well as the company 's brand ; which is now being viewed as negative. I assume one would have created a few mock situations, running them completely through, as a proactive approach and a way to resolve root causes in a timely manner. \nPlease understand I have been a customer with Rush since it launched, give or take a year. Although the card is not the best of them currently in the market, I have prided myself on being involved in what appeared to be a company that believed in the underbanked and had the backing of XXXX XXXX, who outside of rush I respect. Rush vision was to provide financial power to those who are/were underbanked, have the desire to establish credit or rebuild credit, among other things. \nIn addition to this I have even recommended family and friends who really had no desire to have a Rush card get one, as this allowed us to transfer money from one card to another for XXXX versus using XXXX XXXX or XXXX = Financial power/flexibility. By the way this service is no longer working ; which means there is no need for them or even myself to stay with Rush. Understand, I am very loyal and despite me being able to use a normal bank I enjoy the transfer to transfer card feature and would much rather not jump ship. \nTo date the changes made within the customer service department and its procedures I have embraced ; however I am at wits end. With all due respect, I am a person that believes in empowering people from all walks of life, but considering one is in a financial bind due to rush, having a person with a language barrier answering questions with lack of knowledge is extremely frustrating. In my opinion despite ones background we all deserve equal opportunity however Rush has not provided their workers with the adequate tools to successfully address the current needs. \nInstead customer service places you on hold for over XXXX mins, then the phone lines disconnect. Please see below example A. of just one of my many calls to Rush, where I was on hold for a long time and then line disconnected. \nAlso to add assault to injury on my part, I either lost my wallet or it was stolen, needless to say, as normal immediately I contacted Rush by phone and email to freeze, or deactivate the card, and to no avail, due to the IT issues. \nBelow is a chain of events about this communication, and by the way the card is still active, and still in risk of someone using it unauthorized. \nAt this point, I do not know what to do because my direct deposit is being issued to this active, but lost card. I have since contacted my HR department who is trying to stop the transaction and issue a live check ; which puts me in further issues, as I will be out of state on payday and will not have any funds or ways to cash the check. My desire was to have the lost/stolen card cancelled and a new one expedited to me over night ; however in not being able to speak to anyone at Rush, this is not feasible again. \nAs you can see Rush team, what should have been a simple IT enhancement, has turned into a financial Amputation, for those of us who believe in you. I have had to use XXXX XXXX to secure funds for my rent, I have had to pay things online with a card I do not have with the hopes whoever finds it does n't use it. I am extremely scared to cancel my ( currently lost ) card because at the least when and if my direct deposit hits</td><td></td><td>Empowerment Ventures, LLC</td><td>VA</td><td>23452</td><td>Web</td><td>Closed with monetary relief</td><td>No</td><td>1623639</td><td>3878</td><td>7</td><td>2015</td><td>Prepaid card</td></tr><tr><td>2015-10-22</td><td>Prepaid card</td><td>Payroll card</td><td>Fraud or scam</td><td></td><td>my payroll direct deposit was never credited to my account, they are blaming a computer glitch however as of today, they have not made good on those funds.

Needless to say with {$1000.00} sitting on a card I ca n't acess has put me in a tight spot as my other cards are used for paying bills and in doing so am left scrambling to purchase other things. The service has been nothing but disspppointing, with NO ONE I have spoken to having no access to view my account, so they say, because many others have had the ability to check. There has been no effort to provide me with any updates other than those found on their site and it 's even more dissappointing that they are lying about being back up and running. I expect there be much more offered by the company than waiving of fees for a few months.

Since then, People have not been able to access their money, have had money disappear from their accounts, etc. If you go to the rushcard page on XXXX, you can see in detail the struggles people have faced. Some have been evicted from their homes, lost their cars, and not been able to buy essential things like food. \nAs for me, I lost my card and requested a replacement card. Since this system outage, I have not been able to access the {$140.00} that was in there when I still had the old card. Since I could access the funds for myself, I decided to just pay the {$140.00} through their bill pay feature to my landlord. I have used their bill pay service in the past to pay my rent and electricity bill. I sent this money to my landlord on the XXXX. She usually receives the money within a week. I called her yesterday ( the XXXX ) and she told me she had not received a check in the mail. I fear that even though it said it was sent on the XXXX it was, in fact, not. My direct deposit from social security was loaded on the XXXX. It is still in my account BUT I can not access it because I can not activate or set a pin for my new card. I have called XXXX different numbers to set my pin on the automated system only to be transferred to a live customer service representative. They would transfer me to a supervisor, or another number where I could supposedly activate my card. I was either put on hold with no one answering or directed to an automated system that asked me to enter my social security number and the system would say \" Sorry I did not get that '' when I entered my SS #. I have been without money since this transition/outage occurred. It has been THREE WEEKS that have passed where I and others have not been able to use their card but it was \" blocked '' or \" pending activation '' ( which is what my account says on the webpage. I have been going to the food bank during this time with my social worker to get food. I have been without basic necessities such as toilet paper, food for my cats, etc. My main concern is being able to pay my rent and utilities and recovering the {$140.00} that I do not believe was sent to my landlord. As soon as I can recover my funds completely I am switching to a credit union. Naturally this whole situation has caused me stress, anxiety and anger. I can not conceive of a system change that takes 3 WEEKS to work properly. This is completely unacceptable and the worst customer service imaginable.XXXX has stated that he is setting up a \" XXXX dollar '' fund to reimburse those that have incurred late fees or any other damages but he stated also you had to submit proof of this. \nI beg of anyone to help me get my card activated and a pin set up so I can withdraw my funds and pay my bills so my situation does not get serious with eviction or being severely behind on my bills.

I do n't have any money, I had to change my kids school because I moved and almost lost my job because of days I missed and came in late. My job will not issue me paper check from check received on XXXX/XXXX/2015 because the funds were not sent back to them so I now have no way to get my check that was direct deposited a week ago. I can not purchase food, winter uniforms for my kids, pay my car note or pay for a taxi to get to and from work, find another place to live because I will have a non payment eviction and it will be hard to find another apartment for my family to live in with an eviction.</td><td></td><td>Empowerment Ventures, LLC</td><td>LA</td><td>708XX</td><td>Web</td><td>Closed with monetary relief</td><td>No</td><td>1631084</td><td>1458</td><td>4</td><td>2015</td><td>Prepaid card</td></tr><tr><td>2015-10-24</td><td>Prepaid card</td><td>General purpose card</td><td>Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues</td><td></td><td>Rushcard has tied up XXXX $ since XXXX XXXX they charging me a double transaction at XXXX XXXX for XXXX atm withdrawal of XXXX plus atm fee.

I opened a XXXX account and have been with them since. Recently, I wanted to go back to Rushcard because I liked getting paid 2 days earlier. On or about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I called Rushcard to make sure everything was ok with their system and if my account was ok for direct deposit again. I was told that everything was good, thanked me for being a customer since XX/XX/XXXX and never mentioned any negative balance. I was in contact with Rushcard for over a week before my direct deposit went in and.no one ever mentioned a negative balance until I called them about not receiving my pay. Rushcard is saying that they deposited my payroll twice in error. From XX/XX/XXXX I was never contacted about this. I am a XXXXyr old grandmother of XXXX on a budget and they just took my entire paycheck, XXXX. I had to borrow money to pay my rent. I can not pay my utilities. I called and begged them to make some kind of payment arrangement with me but not to take my entire pay. They told me they would escalate the issue and it would take 2 business days. This was on Friday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called them back after not hearing anything on Wednesday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told my money would be posted back to my account in 2 business days. When I called back on Thursday about not seeing my next paycheck I was told that the information about the pay they took going back to my account was incorrect. I was counting on this, making promises to my bill companies and all. She said if no one contacted me in 2 business days, that meant the escalation was denied..This is a huge huge loss I can not have. I will be in the dark, my cable and car will be gone. Rushcard should not be able to make people suffer for their mistakes. i thought the extra money was the compensation rushcard was giving customers. They never said how much or when they would be doing it. I am perfectly willing to pay the money back but not like this. I am suffering a great deal. My bills were already late so now i am in desperate trouble. These people can not get away with this! I am going back to XXXX. I would have never gone back to a company knowing i took funds from them. I did not know and they never told me, just took my money. I will also lose my health insurance which i desperately need.

Well I called in for a replacement card with mine being damaged. I was told 7 to 10 days. 2 weeks later still no replacement card. Then finally it came in the mail. I opened it to realize it was the same numbers just different expiration dates and different XXXX numbers on the back of the card. Didnt think anything of it. Well after calling for another 2 weeks i recieved my funds on my card XX/XX/2015. So the system told me my card was activated as well. One problem i had i couldnt remember the pin number so i called. Put my info in with new XXXX digit code on back and the operator told me wrong number. After a few times i tried my previous XXXX code from my first card and it still told me the same thing. So i got transfered to soneone i could speak to. Which shocked me. Few weeks prior i would have to select the feature of applying for a new card to talk to anyone live. So the gentleman told me i should have not gotten the same number when they replace card came in. I told him its not lost, no one has it. I had just damaged it accidently and i couldnt use it at all to swipe or to withdrawl. So didnt see how it would really make a difference. So, now once again he deactivated the card and sent me out a new one. Today is Wednesday and he told me it would be here Friday. I am wondering if this is the start of another two week checking my mail box to no card. Or better yet get charged for another replacement card that is sent quicker which costs more money. Someone has to pay for it. Either way I am back at square one with a XXXX Dodge Avenger that is about to be in a reporting for non payment which will effect my credit. I have been trying to play catch up for a month now and i am still struggling being a single mom with XXXX children who i dont get any support for. So, i dont just have that kind of money to throw away or wait for. When i got this prepaid card i didnt think their was ever going to be such a hassel. Boy was i wrong. Makes we want to stick to the local banks where i can actually go in and see and talk to someone when issues arise. \nI guess i am wondering what Rushcard is going to do to help me when my car payment goes over a 30 day late payment where my account will be considered delinquent. They report me to all three major credit bureos. Which i spent over a year paying an agency to help get my credit half way decent. Now, a gliche, update system, whatever Rushcard 's excuses were, once again in a diffrent aspect is back to square one. Please get this fixed and help me out so I can get my fiancial statements up to date and live my life stress free again. Never would imagine this would or even could happen until it has to me. \nAlso a little helpful note. It would be a little stressfree to be able to speak to someone that understands me and well as i can understand them. \nOnce again. I just want to be able to get to my funds as well as making sure my car doesnt get reported to consumer reports. \nThanks</td><td></td><td>Empowerment Ventures, LLC</td><td>SC</td><td></td><td>Web</td><td>Closed with monetary relief</td><td>No</td><td>1650776</td><td>3179</td><td>3</td><td>2015</td><td>Prepaid card</td></tr><tr><td>2015-10-23</td><td>Prepaid card</td><td>General purpose card</td><td>Managing, opening, or closing account</td><td></td><td>My account was blocked during the system outage and I had been without access to my money for almost 2 weeks.

During the investigation, they stopped usage of my current debit card and issued me a new card. Upon receiving the new card, the company was in the midst of a very large upgrade to their services. When I went to activate my new debit card, it would not accept the information via telephone to activate the new card. Upon logging in online, I noticed that the new card displayed online on my account did not match the one I received in the mail. Due to the large epically failed overhaul, I was not able to reach customer service via telephone for the first 24 hours. During this time, I sent an email and was issued a ticket number and an automated response saying they would respond within 12 hours. As of XXXX/XXXX/2015, I still have not received a response. I have gotten thru to customer service after several failed attempts and was given a response that \" I need to wait for the website overhaul to finish and the account numbers would be updated. That never happened either. I have been put on hold, hung up on, passed along and still can not access my XXXX payroll deposit that was put in my account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I talked to customer service last night and they were going to issue me a pin number to resolve this issue but they hung up or disconnected before I could receive the number. I have faxed, called, and emailed numerous times and to numerous affiliates and hit a dead end everytime. I have reached the end where this is no longer acceptable customer service. \nAfter weeks of run-arround and dead ends. Rushcard customer service states that 1. They do not have access to accountholders information and when requesting to consult with supervisor, I was transferred to a person who was able to access my account info but still could not resolve my problem. I have paid {$30.00} for an expidited fee for a replacement card that was blocked before I even received it, and not offered a refund of that {$30.00}. It is XX/XX/XXXX15, and I still can not access my money on this account.
